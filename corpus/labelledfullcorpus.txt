My name is Amit // . And 18 months ago, // I had another job at Google, // and I pitched this idea of doing something / with museums / and art to my boss // who's actually here, // and she allowed me to do it // . And it took 18 months // . A lot of fun, // negotiations / and stories, // I can tell you, // with 17 very interesting museums / from nine countries // . But / I'm going to focus on the demo // . There are a lot of stories about // why we did this // . 

I think / my personal story is explained very simply / on the slide, // and it's access // . And / I grew up in India // . I had a great education // -- I'm not complaining // -- but / I didn't have access to a lot of these museums / and these artworks // . And so // when I started traveling / and going to these museums,// I started learning a lot // . And / while working at Google, // I tried to put this desire / to make it more accessible / with technology together // . So we formed a team, // a great team of people, // and we started doing this // . 

I'm going to probably get into the demo / and then tell you a couple of the interesting things // we've had since launch // . So, // simple: // you come to GoogleArtProject. com // . You look around at all these museums here // . You've got the Uffizi, // you've got the MoMA, // the Hermitage, / the Rijks, / the Van Gogh // . I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, // the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York // . Two ways of going in // -- very simple // . Click and, / bang, // you're in this museum // . It doesn't matter / where you are // -- Bombay, / Mexico, // it doesn't really matter // . You move around, // you have fun // . You want to navigate around the museum // ? Open the plan up, // and, / in one click, // jump // . You're in there, // you want to go to the end of the corridor // . Keep going // . Have fun // . Explore // . 

Thanks // . I haven't come to the best part // . 

So now // I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, // "The Harvesters" / by Pieter Bruegel / at the Met // . I see this plus sign // . If the museum has given us the image, // you click on it // . Now / this is one of the images // . So / this is all of the meta-data information // . For those of you who are truly interested in art, // you can click this // -- but / I'm going to click this off right now // . And / this is one of these images // that we captured in / what we call gigapixel technology // . So this image, // for example, // has close to, // I think, // around 10 billion pixels // . And / I get a lot of people asking me: // "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" // So / I'm going to try / and show you / what you really get for 10 billion pixels // . You can zoom around very simply // . You see some fun stuff happening here // . I love this guy; // his expression is priceless // . 

But / then you really want to go deep // . And / so I started playing around, // and I found something going on over here // . And / I was like, // "Hold on // . That sounds interesting. " // Went in, // and I started noticing that // these kids were actually beating something // . I did a little research, / spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, / and actually found out that this is a game called squall, // which involves beating a goose / with a stick on Shrove Tuesday // . And apparently // it was quite popular // . I don't know // why they did it, // but / I learned something about it // . Now / just to get really deep in, // you can really get to the cracks // . Now / just to give you some perspective, // I'm going to zoom out / so you really see what you get // . Here is where we were, // and this is the painting // . 

The best is yet to come // -- so in a second // . So now / let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, // again in New York // . So another one of my favorites, // "The Starry Night. " // Now the example / I showed you was all about finding details // . But / what if you want to see brush strokes // ? And / what if you want to see / how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece // ? You zoom in // . You really go in // . I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts / in this painting, // and I'm really going to get to the cracks // . This is "The Starry Night," // I think, // never seen like this before // . 

I'm going to show you my other favorite feature // . There's a lot of other stuff here, // but / I don't have time // . This is the real cool part // . It's called Collections // . Any one of you, // anybody //-- doesn't matter / if you're rich, // if you're poor, // if you have a fancy house // -- doesn't matter // . You can go / and create your own museum online // -- create your own collection / across all these images // . Very simply,// you go in // -- and I've created this, // called The Power of Zoom // -- you can just zoom around // . This is "The Ambassadors," // based in the National Gallery // . You can annotate the stuff, // send it to your friends / and really get a conversation going about / what you're feeling / when you go through these masterpieces // . 

So I think, // in conclusion, // for me, // the main thing is that // all the amazing stuff here / does not really come from Google // . It doesn't, // in my opinion, // even come from the museums // . I probably shouldn't say that // . It really comes from these artists // . And that's been my humbling experience in this // . I mean, // I hope in this digital medium / that we do justice to their artwork / and represent it properly online // . And the biggest question / I get asked nowadays is, // "Did you do this / to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" // And the answer is no // . It's to supplement the experience // . 
What do you do // when you have a headache // ? You swallow an aspirin // . But / for this pill to get to your head, // where the pain is, // it goes through your stomach, / intestines / and various other organs first // . 

Swallowing pills / is the most effective / and painless way /of delivering any medication in the body // . The downside, // though, // is that // swallowing any medication leads to its dilution // . And this is a big problem, // particularly in HIV patients // . When they take their anti-HIV drugs, // these drugs are good / for lowering the virus in the blood, // and increasing the CD4 cell counts // . But / they are also notorious / for their adverse side effects, // but / mostly bad, // because // they get diluted by the time / they get to the blood, // and worse, // by the time they get to the sites / where it matters most: // within the HIV viral reservoirs // . These areas in the body // -- such as the lymph nodes, // the nervous system, // as well as the lungs // -- where the virus is sleeping, // and will not readily get delivered / in the blood of patients / that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy // . However, // upon discontinuation of therapy, // the virus can awake / and infect new cells in the blood // . 

Now, // all this is a big problem in treating HIV / with the current drug treatment, // which is a life-long treatment / that must be swallowed by patients // . One day, // I sat / and thought, // "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly / within its reservoir sites, // without the risk of drug dilution?" // As a laser scientist, // the answer was just before my eyes: // Lasers, // of course // . If they can be used for dentistry, // for diabetic wound-healing / and surgery, // they can be used for anything imaginable, // including transporting drugs into cells // . 

As a matter of fact, // we are currently using laser pulses / to poke / or drill extremely tiny holes, // which open / and close almost immediately / in HIV-infected cells, // in order to deliver drugs within them // . "How is that possible?" // you may ask // . Well, // we shine a very powerful // but / super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells // while these cells are immersed in liquid / containing the drug // . The laser pierces the cell, // while the cell swallows the drug / in a matter of microseconds // . Before you even know it, // the induced hole becomes immediately repaired // . 

Now, // we are currently testing this technology / in test tubes / or in Petri dishes, // but / the goal is to get this technology in the human body, // apply it in the human body // . "How is that possible?" // you may ask // . Well, // the answer is: // through a three-headed device // . Using the first head, // which is our laser, // we will make an incision in the site of infection // . Using the second head, // which is a camera, // we meander to the site of infection // . Finally, // using a third head, // which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, // we deliver the drugs / directly at the site of infection, // while the laser is again used / to poke those cells open // . 

Well, // this might not seem like / much right now // . But one day, // if successful, // this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body // . Yes // . A cure for HIV // . This is every HIV researcher's dream // -- in our case, // a cure lead by lasers // . 
So I was trained to become a gymnast / for two years in Hunan, // China in the 1970s // . When I was in the first grade, // the government wanted to transfer me to a school / for athletes, // all expenses paid // . But / my tiger mother said, // "No // . " My parents wanted me to become an engineer / like them // . After surviving the Cultural Revolution, // they firmly believed // there's only one sure way to happiness // : a safe / and well-paid job // . It is not important // if I like the job / or not. 

But / my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer // . That is me playing my imaginary piano // . An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, // so I tried everything I could / to go to opera school // . I even wrote to the school principal / and the host of a radio show // . But / no adults liked the idea // . No adults believed // I was serious // . Only my friends supported me, // but / they were kids, // just as powerless as I was // . So at age 15, // I knew I was too old to be trained // . My dream would never come true // . I was afraid that // for the rest of my life / some second-class happiness would be the best / I could hope for // . 

But / that's so unfair // . So I was determined to find another calling // . Nobody around to teach me // ? Fine // . I turned to books // . 

I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book / by a family of writers / and musicians. // ["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] //

I found my role model of an independent woman // when Confucian tradition requires obedience // . ["Jane Eyre"] //

And I learned to be efficient from this book // . ["Cheaper by the Dozen"] //

And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these // . 

["Complete Works of Sanmao" // (aka Echo Chan) // ] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] //

I came to the U. S.  in / 1995, // so which books did I read here first // ? Books banned in China, // of course // . "The Good Earth" / is about Chinese peasant life // . That's just not convenient for propaganda // . Got it // . The Bible is interesting, // but / strange // . That's a topic for a different day // . But / the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany // : "You shall honor your father / and mother // . " "Honor // ," I said // . "That's so different, // and better, // than obey // . " So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap / and to restart my relationship with my parents // . 

Encountering a new culture / also started my habit of comparative reading // . It offers many insights // . For example, // I found this map out of place at first // because / this is what Chinese students grew up with // . It had never occurred to me, // China doesn't have to be at the center of the world // . A map actually carries somebody's view // . Comparative reading actually / is nothing new // . It's a standard practice / in the academic world // . There are even research fields // such as comparative religion / and comparative literature // . 

Compare / and contrast / gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic // . So I thought, // well, // if comparative reading works for research, // why not do it in daily life too // ? So I started reading books in pairs // . So they can be about people // -- ["Benjamin Franklin" / by Walter Isaacson]// ["John Adams" / by David McCullough] // -- who are involved in the same event, // or friends with shared experiences // . ["Personal History" / by Katharine Graham] // ["The Snowball:// Warren Buffett / and the Business of Life, // " by Alice Schroeder] // I also compare the same stories / in different genres // -- [Holy Bible: // King James Version] // ["Lamb" / by Chrisopher Moore] // -- or similar stories from different cultures, // as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book // . ["The Power of Myth" / by Joseph Campbell] // For example, // both the Christ / and the Buddha went through three temptations // . For the Christ, // the temptations are economic, / political / and spiritual // . For the Buddha, // they are all psychological: // lust, / fear / and social duty // -- interesting // . 

So if you know a foreign language, // it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages // . ["The Way of Chuang Tzu" // Thomas Merton]// ["Tao: / The Watercourse Way" // Alan Watts] // Instead of lost in translation, // I found / there is much to gain // . For example, // it's through translation that // I realized / "happiness" in Chinese literally means / "fast joy. " // Huh // ! "Bride" / in Chinese literally / means "new mother. " //

Books have given me a magic portal / to connect with people of the past / and the present // . I know / I shall never feel lonely / or powerless again // . Having a dream shattered really / is nothing compared to / what many others have suffered // . I have come to believe that / coming true / is not the only purpose of a dream // . Its most important purpose is / to get us in touch with // where dreams come from, // where passion comes from, // where happiness comes from // . Even a shattered dream can do that for you // . 

So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time.  So may books be always with you. 
So, / if you're in the audience today, / or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time / or place, // you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem // . Whether you're an artist, / a technologist, / a lawyer / or a fan, // the handling of copyright directly impacts your life // . Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, // it's a complex web of relationships / and a critical part of our cultural landscape // . YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, // but / in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, / mashups / and more, // we need to first identify / when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site // . 

Let's look at a specific video / so you can see how it works // . Two years ago, // recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever. " // A fan saw it on TV, // recorded it with her camera phone, // and uploaded it to YouTube // . Because / Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, // within seconds of attempting to upload the video, // the copy was detected, // giving Sony the choice of what to do next // . 

But / how do we know that / the user's video was a copy // ? Well, // it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, // along with a usage policy / that tells us what to do / when we find a match // . We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database // . This heat map is going to show you / how the brain of the system works // . Here we can see the original reference file / being compared to the user generated content // . The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match // . This means that // we can identify a match / even if the copy used is / just a portion of the original file, / plays it in slow motion / and has degraded audio / and video quality // . And we do this every time / that a video is uploaded to YouTube // . And that's over 20 hours of video every minute // . When we find a match, // we apply the policy / that the rights owner has set down // . 

And the scale / and the speed of this system / is truly breathtaking. // We're not just talking about a few videos, // we're talking about over 100 years of video every day, // between new uploads / and the legacy scans // we regularly do across all of the content on the site // . When we compare those hundred years of video, // we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database // . It would be like 36,000 people / staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, // without so much as a coffee break // . 

Now, // what do we do when we find a match // ? Well,// most rights owners, // instead of blocking, // will allow the copy to be published // . And then they benefit through the exposure, // advertising / and linked sales // . Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever" // ? Well, // it had its day in the sun / and then it dropped off the charts, // and that looked like the end of the story, // but / sometime last year, // a young couple got married // . This is their wedding video // . You may have seen it // . 

What's amazing about this is, // if the processional of the wedding / was this much fun, // can you imagine / how much fun the reception must have been // ? I mean, // who are these people // ? I totally want to go to that wedding // . 

So / their little wedding video went on / to get over 40 million views // . And instead of Sony blocking, // they allowed the upload to occur // . And they put advertising against it / and linked from it to iTunes // . And the song, // 18 months old, // went back to number four on the iTunes charts // . So / Sony is generating revenue from both of these // . And Jill / and Kevin, // the happy couple, // they came back from their honeymoon / and found that / their video had gone crazy viral // . And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, // and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference // . The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence // . The "JK Wedding Dance" / became so popular that / NBC parodied it on the season finale of "// The Office, // " which just goes to show, // it's truly an ecosystem of culture // . Because / it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, // but / sometimes big studios borrowing back. 

By empowering choice, // we can create a culture of opportunity // . And all it took to change things around / was to allow for choice through rights identification // . So / why has no one ever solved this problem before // ? It's because / it's a big problem, // and it's complicated / and messy // . It's not uncommon for a single video / to have multiple rights owners // . There's musical labels // . There's multiple music publishers // . And each of these can vary by country // . There's lots of cases / where we have more than one work mashed together. // So/ we have to manage many claims to the same video // . 

YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases // . But / the system only works through the participation of rights owners // . If you have content / that others are uploading to YouTube, // you should register in the Content ID system, // and then / you'll have the choice about / how your content is used // . And think carefully about the policies / that you attach to that content // . By simply blocking all reuse, // you'll miss out on new art forms, / new audiences, / new distribution channels / and new revenue streams // . 

But / it's not just about dollars / and impressions. // Just look at all the joy / that was spread through progressive rights management / and new technology // . And I think / we can all agree that / joy is definitely an idea worth spreading // . 
I was born in Taiwan // . I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, // and I like going to night markets // . I love the energy of the night markets, // the colors, // the lights, // the toys, // and all the unexpected things / I find every time / I go, // things like / watermelon with straw antennas / or puppies with mohawks // . When I was growing up, // I liked taking toys apart, // any kind of toys / I'd find around the house, // like my brother's BB gun / when he's not home // . 

I also liked to make environments for people / to explore / and play // . In these early installations, // I would take plastic sheets, / plastic bags, / and things / I would find in the hardware store / or around the house // . I would take things like / highlighter pen, // mix it with water, // pump it through plastic tubing, // creating these glowing circulatory systems / for people to walk through / and enjoy // . I like these materials / because of the way they look, // the way they feel, // and they're very affordable // . 

I also liked to make devices // that work with body parts // . I would take camera LED lights // and a bungee cord // and strap it on my waist // and I would videotape my belly button, // get a different perspective, // and see what it does // . 

I also like to modify household appliances // . This is an automatic night light // . Some of you might have them at home // . I would cut out the light sensor, // add an extension line, // and use modeling clay, // stick it onto the television, // and then // I would videotape my eye, // and using the dark part of my eye / tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, // so / you turn on the lightbulb // . The white of the eye / and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime, // and it will shut off the light // . 

I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, // so / I built this device using bicycle helmets, / some lightbulbs / and television sets // . It would be easier for other people / to wear the helmet / and record their eyes // . This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, // so / I have a diversity of eyes / to use for my other sculptures // . This sculpture has four eyes // . Each eye is controlling a different device // . This eye is turning itself around in a television // . This eye is inflating a plastic tube // . This eye is watching a video of another piece being made // . And / these two eyes are activating glowing water // . Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, / biennials, / triennial exhibitions around the world. 

I love science / and biology // . In 2007, // I was doing a research fellowship at / the Smithsonian Natural History Museum / looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean // . I love these creatures // . I love the way they look, // the way they feel // . They're soft, // they're slimy, // and I was fascinated by the way / they use light in their environment, // either to attract mates, / for self-defense, / or to attract food // . This research inspired my work in many different ways, // things like movement / or different light patterns // . So / I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio / and just experimenting / and trying this out, / trying that out, // and seeing / what types of creatures / I can come up with // . I used a lot of computer cooling fans / and just kind of put them together / and see what happens // . This is an 8,000-square-foot installation / composed of many different creatures, // some hanging from the ceiling / and some resting on the floor // . From afar, // they look alien-like, // but / when you look closer, // they're all made out of black garbage bags / or Tupperware containers // . 

I'd like to share with you // how ordinary things can become something magical / and wondrous // . 
In 2012, // when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque / in my hometown of Gabes, // in the south of Tunisia, // I never thought that // graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. //

At the beginning, // I was just looking for a wall / in my hometown, // and it happened that // the minaret was built in '94 // . And for 18 years, // those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey // . When I met the imam for the first time, // and I told him / what I wanted to do, // he was like, // "Thank God you finally came," // and he told me that // for years // he was waiting for somebody / to do something on it // . The most amazing thing about this imam / is that // he didn't ask me anything // -- neither a sketch, // or what I was going to write. //

In every work / that I create, // I write messages / with my style of calligraffiti // -- a mix of calligraphy / and graffiti // . I use quotes / or poetry // . For the minaret, // I thought that // the most relevant message to be put on a mosque // should come from the Quran, // so I picked this verse: // "Oh humankind, // we have created you from a male / and a female, // and made you people / and tribe, // so you may know each other. " // It was a universal call for peace, / tolerance, / and acceptance / coming from the side // that we don't usually portray / in a good way in the media // . 

I was amazed to see // how the local community reacted to the painting, // and how it made them proud / to see the minaret getting so much attention / from international press all around the world // . For the imam, // it was not just the painting; // it was really deeper than that // . He hoped that // this minaret would become a monument for the city, // and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia // . The universality of the message, // the political context of Tunisia at this time, // and the fact that // I was writing Quran in a graffiti way / were not insignificant // . It reunited the community // . 

Bringing people, // future generations, // together through Arabic calligraphy / is what I do // . Writing messages / is the essence of my artwork // . What is funny, // actually, // is that // even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot / to decipher / what I'm writing // . You don't need to know the meaning / to feel the piece // . I think that // Arabic script touches your soul / before it reaches your eyes // . There is a beauty in it // that you don't need to translate // . Arabic script speaks to anyone, // I believe; // to you, / to you, / to you, / to anybody, // and then // when you get the meaning, // you feel connected to it // . I always make sure to write messages // that are relevant to the place // where I'm painting, // but messages / that have a universal dimension, // so anybody around the world can connect to it // . 

I was born / and raised in France, / in Paris, // and I started learning // how to write / and read Arabic // when I was 18 // . Today // I only write messages in Arabic // . One of the reasons / this is so important to me, / is // because of // all the reaction / that I've experienced all around the world // . 

In Rio de Janeiro, // I translated this Portuguese poem / from Gabriela Torres Barbosa, // who was giving an homage to the poor people / of the favela, // and then // I painted it on the rooftop // . The local community were really intrigued by what / was doing, // but / as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, // they thanked me, // as they felt connected to the piece // . 

In South Africa, // in Cape Town, // the local community of Philippi / offered me the only concrete wall of the slum // . It was a school, // and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, // saying, // "[in Arabic]," // which means, // "It seems impossible until it's done. " // Then this guy came to me / and said, // "Man, // why you don't write in English?" // and I replied to him, // "I would consider your concern legit // if you asked me // why I didn't write in Zulu. "//

In Paris, // once, // there was this event, // and someone gave his wall to be painted // . And / when he saw / I was painting in Arabic, // he got so mad // -- actually, // hysterical // -- and he asked for the wall to be erased // . I was mad / and disappointed // . But / a week later, // the organizer of the event asked me to come back, // and he told me that // there was a wall / right in front of this guy's house // . So, // this guy like, // was forced to see it every day // . At the beginning, // I was going to write, // "[In Arabic]," // which means, // "In your face," // but / -- (Laughter) I decided to be smarter // and I wrote, // "[In Arabic]," // which means, // "Open your heart. " //

I'm really proud of my culture, // and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it / through my artwork // . And I hope that // I can break the stereotypes / we all know, // with the beauty of Arabic script // . Today, // I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall // . I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy / to be broken, // as it's art // and you can appreciate it / without knowing the meaning, // as you can enjoy any music / from other countries // . Some people see that // as a rejection / or a closed door, // but for me, // it's more an invitation // -- to my language, // to my culture, // and to my art // . 
I'm really excited to share with you some findings / that really surprise me about / what makes companies succeed the most, // what factors actually matter the most for startup success // . 

I believe that / the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place // . If you take a group of people / with the right equity incentives / and organize them in a startup, // you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible // . You get them to achieve unbelievable things // . 

But / if the startup organization is so great, // why do so many fail // ? That's what I wanted to find out // . I wanted to find out / what actually matters most for startup success // . 

And I wanted to try to be systematic about it, // avoid some of my instincts / and maybe misperceptions / I have from so many companies I've seen over the years // . 

I wanted to know this because // I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old // when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school, // to high school, / when I made solar energy devices, // to college, / when I made loudspeakers // . And when I graduated from college, // I started software companies // . And 20 years ago, // I started Idealab, // and in the last 20 years, // we started more than 100 companies, / many successes, / and many big failures // . We learned a lot from those failures // . 

So I tried to look across // what factors accounted the most for company success / and failure // . So I looked at these five // . First, // the idea // . I used to think that / the idea was everything // . I named my company Idealab / for how much I worship the "aha!" moment // when you first come up with the idea // . But / then over time, // I came to think that // maybe the team, / the execution, / adaptability, / that mattered even more than the idea // . 

I never thought / I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,// but he once said, // "Everybody has a plan, // until they get punched in the face. " // And I think / that's so true about business as well // . So much about a team's execution is / its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer // . The customer is the true reality // . And that's why / I came to think that / the team maybe was the most important thing // . 

Then I started looking at the business model // . Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues // ? That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe / what mattered most for success // . 

Then I looked at the funding // . Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding // . Maybe that's the most important thing // ?

And then of course, // the timing // . Is the idea way too early / and the world's not ready for it // ? Is it early, // as in, // you're in advance / and you have to educate the world // ? Is it just right // ? Or is it too late, // and there's already too many competitors // ?

So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies // . And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies, // and 100 non-Idealab companies to try / and come up with something scientific about it // . 

So first, // on these Idealab companies, // the top five companies // -- Citysearch, / CarsDirect, / GoTo, / NetZero, / Tickets. com / -- those all became billion-dollar successes // . And the five companies on the bottom // -- Z. com, // Insider Pages, // MyLife, // Desktop Factory, // Peoplelink // -- we all had high hopes for, // but didn't succeed // . 

So I tried to rank across all of those attributes / how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions // . And then for non-Idealab companies, // I looked at wild successes, // like Airbnb / and Instagram / and Uber / and Youtube / and LinkedIn // . 

And some failures: // Webvan, // Kozmo, // Pets. com Flooz // and Friendster // . The bottom companies had intense funding, // they even had business models in some cases, // but they didn't succeed // . I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success / and failure across all of these companies, // and the results really surprised me // . 

The number one thing was timing // . Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure // . Team and execution came in second, // and the idea, // the differentiability of the idea, // the uniqueness of the idea, // that actually came in third // . 

Now, // this isn't absolutely definitive, // it's not to say that the idea isn't important, // but it very much surprised me that // the idea wasn't the most important thing // . Sometimes it mattered more / when it was actually timed // . 

The last two, // business model / and funding, // made sense to me actually // . I think business model makes sense to be that low // because you can start out without a business model // and add one later if your customers are demanding / what you're creating // . And funding, // I think as well, // if you're underfunded at first // but / you're gaining traction, // especially in today's age, // it's very, / very easy to get intense funding // . 

So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these // . So take a wild success like Airbnb // that everybody knows about // . Well, // that company was famously passed on by many smart investors // because people thought, // "No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger. " // Of course, // people proved that wrong // . But one of the reasons it succeeded, // aside from a good business model, // a good idea, // great execution, // is the timing // . 

That company came out right during the height of the recession // when people really needed extra money, // and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger // . 

Same thing with Uber // . Uber came out, // incredible company, // incredible business model, // great execution, // too // . But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system // . Drivers were looking for extra money; // it was very, / very important // . 

Some of our early successes, // Citysearch, // came out when people needed web pages // . GoTo. com, // which we announced actually at TED in 1998, // was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic // . We thought the idea was so great, // but actually, // the timing was probably maybe more important // . And then some of our failures // . We started a company called Z. com, // it was an online entertainment company // . We were so excited about it // -- we raised enough money, // we had a great business model, // we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company // . But / broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000 // . It was too hard to watch video content online, // you had to put codecs in your browser / and do all this stuff, // and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 // . 

Just two years later, // when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash // and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America, // YouTube was perfectly timed // . Great idea, // but unbelievable timing // . In fact, // YouTube didn't even have a business model / when it first started // . It wasn't even certain that // that would work out // . But / that was beautifully, / beautifully timed // . 

So what I would say, // in summary, // is execution definitely matters a lot // . The idea matters a lot // . But / timing might matter even more // . And the best way to really assess timing is // to really look at / whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them // . And to be really, / really honest about it, // not be in denial about any results that you see, // because / if you have something you love, // you want to push it forward, // but / you have to be very, / very honest about that factor on timing // . 

As I said earlier, // I think startups can change the world / and make the world a better place // . I hope some of these insights / can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio, // and thus make something great come to the world // that wouldn't have happened otherwise // . 

Thank you very much, // you've been a great audience // . 
Ladies and gentlemen, // gather around // . I would love to share with you a story. //

Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, // there was the book // . Now during this time, // the book was the king of storytelling // . It was venerable // . It was ubiquitous // . But it was a little bit boring // . Because in its 400 years of existence, // storytellers never evolved the book / as a storytelling device // . But / then / one author arrived, // and he changed the game forever // . His name was Lothar, // Lothar Meggendorfer // . Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, // and he said, // "Genug ist genug!" // He grabbed his pen, // he snatched his scissors // . This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy / and just decided to fold // . History would know Lothar Meggendorfer / as // -- who else // ? -- the world's first true inventor / of the children's pop-up book // . For this delight / and for this wonder, // people rejoiced // . They were happy / because // the story survived, // and that / the world would keep on spinning // . 

Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first / to evolve the way a story was told, // and he certainly wasn't the last // . Whether storytellers realized it / or not, // they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit // when they moved opera to vaudville, // radio news to radio theater, // film to film in motion / to film in sound, / color, / 3D, / on VHS / and on DVD // . There seemed to be no cure / for this Meggendorferitis // . 

And things got a lot more fun / when the Internet came around // . Because, // not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, // but / they could do so / using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices // . For example, // one company would tell a story of love / through its very own search engine // . One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D // . And / one man would tell the stories of his father / by using a platform called Twitter // to communicate the excrement / his father would gesticulate // . 

And / after all this, // everyone paused; // they took a step back // . They realized that, // in 6,000 years of storytelling, // they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls / to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls // . And / this was a cause for celebration // . The art of storytelling has remained unchanged // . And / for the most part, // the stories are recycled // . But / the way / that humans tell the stories / has always evolved with pure, // consistent novelty // . 

And / they remembered a man, // one amazing German, // every time a new storytelling device popped up next // . And for that,// the audience // -- the lovely, // beautiful audience // -- would live happily ever after // . 
My students / and I work on very tiny robots // . Now, // you can think of these as robotic versions of something / that you're all very familiar with: // an ant // . We all know that / ants / and other insects at this size scale / can do some pretty incredible things // . We've all seen a group of ants, / or some version of that, / carting off your potato chip at a picnic, / for example // . 

But / what are the real challenges of engineering these ants // ? Well, // first of all, // how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale // ? Well, // first / we need to figure out how to make them move / when they're so small // . We need mechanisms like / legs / and efficient motors / in order to / support that locomotion, // and we need the sensors, / power / and control in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot // . And finally, // to make these things really functional, // we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things // . 

So I'll start with mobility // . Insects move around amazingly well // . This video is from UC Berkeley // . It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain / without tipping over, / and it's able to do this // because / its legs are a combination of rigid materials, // which is what / we traditionally use to make robots, / and soft materials // . Jumping is another really interesting way to get around / when you're very small // . So these insects store energy in a spring / and release that really quickly / to get the high power they need to jump out of water, / for example // . 

So one of the big contributions from my lab / has been to combine rigid / and soft materials in very, / very small mechanisms // . So this jumping mechanism / is about four millimeters on a side, / so really tiny // . The hard material here is silicon, / and the soft material is silicone rubber // . And the basic idea is that // we're going to compress this, // store energy in the springs, // and then release it to jump // . So there's no motors on board this right now, // no power // . This is actuated with a method / that we call in my lab / "graduate student with tweezers. " // So what you'll see in the next video / is this guy / doing amazingly well for its jumps // . So this is Aaron, / the graduate student in question, / with the tweezers, / and what you see is / this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high // . That's almost 100 times its own length // . And it survives, // bounces on the table, // it's incredibly robust, // and of course / survives quite well /until we lose it / because it's very tiny // . 

Ultimately, // though, // we want to add motors to this too, // and we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors / to eventually integrate onto small, / autonomous robots // . But / in order to look at mobility / and locomotion / at this size scale to start, // we're cheating / and using magnets // . So this shows // what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg, // and you can see the silicone rubber joints / and there's an embedded magnet / that's being moved around by an external magnetic field // . 

So this leads to the robot / that I showed you earlier // . The really interesting thing / that this robot can help us figure out // is how insects move at this scale // . We have a really good model / for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves // . We all move in this kind of bouncy way / when we run // . But / when I'm really small, // the forces between my feet / and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass, // which is what causes that bouncy motion // . So this guy doesn't work quite yet, // but / we do have slightly larger versions that do run around // . So this is about a centimeter cubed, / a centimeter on a side, / so very tiny, / and we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second, / so 10 centimeters per second // . It's pretty quick for a little, / small guy, / and that's really only limited by our test setup // . But / this gives you some idea of how it works right now // . We can also make 3D-printed versions of this / that can climb over obstacles, // a lot like the cockroach / that you saw earlier // . 

Ultimately / we want to add everything onboard the robot // . We want sensing, / power, / control, / actuation all together, / and not everything needs to be bio-inspired // . So / this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac // . And in this case, // instead of magnets or muscles to move this around, // we use rockets // . So / this is a micro-fabricated energetic material, / and we can create tiny pixels of this, / and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot, / and this robot, / then, / is going to jump / when it senses an increase in light // . 

So / the next video is one of my favorites // . So / you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air // . It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size // . And you'll see a big flash at the beginning / when the energetic is set off, // and the robot tumbling through the air // . So / there was that big flash, // and you can see the robot jumping up through the air // . So there's no tethers on this, // no wires connecting to this // . Everything is onboard, // and it jumped in response to the student / just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. //

So / I think you can imagine all the cool things / that we could do with robots / that can run / and crawl / and jump / and roll at this size scale // . Imagine the rubble / that you get after a natural disaster / like an earthquake // . Imagine these small robots running through that rubble / to look for survivors // . Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge / in order to inspect it / and make sure it's safe / so you don't get collapses like this, // which happened outside of Minneapolis in 2007 // . Or just imagine / what you could do / if you had robots / that could swim through your blood // . Right // ? "Fantastic Voyage,"// Isaac Asimov // . Or they could operate / without having to cut you open in the first place. // Or we could radically change the way we build things // if we have our tiny robots work the same way / that termites do, // and they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds, // effectively well ventilated apartment buildings / for other termites in Africa / and Australia // . 

So I think / I've given you some of the possibilities / of what we can do with these small robots // . And / we've made some advances so far, // but / there's still a long way to go, // and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination // . 

I came here to show you the Fotokite // . It's a tethered, / flying camera //. But / before I do that, // I want to tell you a bit / about where it came from, // what motivated it //.
So / I was born in Russia, // and three years ago, // in 2011, // there were the Russian federal elections //. There were massive irregularities reported, // and people came out to protest, // which was very unlikely for Russia //. And no one really knew / how significant these protests were, // because, // for whatever reason, // the world media largely ignored it //. Now, // there was a group of photographers // who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby //  usually photographing things like the Sphinx, // the Pyramids //  who happened to be right around the corner, // and they flew a camera // and they took some snapshots, // some panoramas of this demonstration // .  Just completely independent entity, // completely random occurrence, // and the image, // when I saw it, // it really struck me //. Here's one of the panoramas // . So in a single image, // you can really see the scale of this event //  just the number of people, // the colors, // the banners // . You just can't consider this insignificant // . All in a single image, // which was really cool to me // .
And I think, // in the future, // journalism / and many other professions, // there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there, // but / I think, // you wait a few months, // a few years, // and for many professions, // it's really going to be a requirement // .
And it make sense // . It's such a unique perspective // . Nothing really communicates this scale, // for example, // in context, // in a way that this does // . But / there are a few hurdles, // and they are quite basic / and quite fundamental // .
One is piloting // . So / for this image, // they flew a camera, // a five kilogram device with an SLR under it // . It's quite heavy, // lots of spinning, // sharp things // . It's a bit uncomfortable to fly, // probably also for the operator // . In fact, // you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, // it says,  // "No questions until landing" // in Russian / and in English, // because / people are curious, // and they'll go tap you, // and then / you lose your focus / and things happen // . And these guys are great // . They're professionals; // they're really careful in what they do // . So / in the protests, // maybe you noticed, // they flew over the river / so it was quite safe // . But / this doesn't necessarily apply to all people / and all conditions, // so we really have to make piloting easier // .
The other problem is regulations, // or rather,  // the lack of good regulation // . For many good reasons, // it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws / to regulate flying cameras //.  So we already have cameras // . Everyone here, // I'm sure, // has a smartphone with a camera, // right // ? There are more and more of them // . You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked // . You hear about, // actually, // a drone pilot, // a hobbyist, // was attacked two weeks ago // because / he was flying near a beach // . Here's some personal input / I didn't expect // . Just yesterday, // I was attacked by a guy // who claimed that / I was filming him // . I was checking my email right here  // easy way to get input for your talk  // . But I think there are better solutions // . I think we have to defuse the situation // . We have to come up with responsible solutions // that address the privacy issues / and the safety, / accountability issues // but / still give us that perspective // .
And this is one potential solution // . So this is the Fotokite // . Well, // let me see, // it's a quadrocopter, // but / what's kind of special about it is / there's a leash // . It's literally a dog leash // . It's very convenient // . And / the neat thing about it is, // to fly it, // there's no joysticks, // nothing like this // . You just turn it on // and you point in the direction / that you want to fly // . You give it a little twist //. That's kind of the way / you communicate //. And there it goes // .
So / the interaction is super simple // . It's like a personal flying pet // . It just always maintains a certain angle to you, // and if I move around with it, // it'll actually follow me naturally // . And of course, // we can build on top of this // . So / this leash has some additional electronics // . You can turn it on // . And now, // it's like telling your dog to fly lower, // if you have such a dog // . So, /  I can press a button / and manipulate it rather easily // . So / I just shifted its position // .
And / it's really safe // . I don't know about you guys in the front row  // (Laughter)  // but / at least in principle, // you have to agree that // you feel safer // because / there is a physical connection // . Live demos are hard, // right // ? Things go wrong all the time // . But / no matter what, // this thing will actually prevent this thing / from going into you // . What's more, // it tells you immediately that // I am the one responsible for this device // . You don't have to look for someone controlling it //.
Now, // I can tell you that it's easy a lot, // but / I think a really good way to prove that is // to grab a second one / and launch it // .  And / if I can do this on stage live, // then / I can show each / and every one of you in five minutes / how to operate one of these devices // .
So now / we have two eyes in the sky // .  And now / the trick is getting them back // . 
So / my question now to you is, // well, // it's a nice solution, // it's very accessible, // it's safe // . What would you use it for // ? What would you use such a camera for in your life // ?
So / just by a show of hands, // how many of you all have a robot at home // ? Not very many of you // . Okay // . And actually of those hands, // if you don't include Roomba // how many of you have a robot at home // ? So a couple // . That's okay // . That's the problem that // we're trying to solve at Romotive --//  that I / and the other 20 nerds at Romotive / are obsessed with solving // .
So / we really want to build a robot // that anyone can use, // whether you're eight / or 80 // . And as it turns out, // that's a really hard problem, // because you have to build a small, / portable robot // that's not only really affordable, // but / it has to be something // that people actually want to take home / and have around their kids // . This robot can't be creepy / or uncanny // . He should be friendly / and cute // .
So / meet Romo // . Romo's a robot // that uses a device / you already know / and love -- // your iPhone -- as his brain //. And / by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor, // we can create a robot // that is wi-fi enabled // and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks, // which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past // .
When Romo wakes up, // he's in creature mode // . So / he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face // . If I duck down, // he'll follow me // . He's wary, // so he'll keep his eyes on me // . If I come over here, // he'll turn to follow me // . If I come over here -- // He's smart // . And / if I get too close to him, // he gets scared just like / any other creature // . So / in a lot of ways, // Romo is like a pet // that has a mind of his own // . Thanks, // little guy // .  Bless you // .
And / if I want to explore the world -- // uh-oh, // Romo's tired -- //  if I want to explore the world with Romo, //  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device // . So / here's the iPad // . And Romo will actually stream video to this device // . So / I can see everything / that Romo sees, // and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world // . Now / this is a free app on the App Store, // so / if any of you guys had this app on your phones, // we could literally right now share control of the robot / and play games together // .
So / I'll show you really quickly, // Romo actually  -// he's streaming video, // so you can see me / and the entire TED audience // . If I get in front of Romo here // . And / if I want to control him, // I can just drive // . So / I can drive him around, // and I can take pictures of you // . I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience // . So / I'll snap a picture // . And in the same way // that you scroll through content on an iPad, // I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device // . So / there are all of you through Romo's eyes // . And finally, // because / Romo is an extension of me, // I can express myself through his emotions // . So / I can go in // and I can say / let's make Romo excited //.
But / the most important thing about Romo is that // we wanted to create something // that was literally completely intuitive // . You do not have to teach someone / how to drive Romo // . In fact, // who would like to drive a robot // ? Okay // . Awesome // . Here you go // . Thank you, // Scott //.
And even cooler, // you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot / to control him //. So / he actually streams two-way audio / and video between any two smart devices // . So / you can log in through the browser, // and it's kind of like Skype on wheels // . So / we were talking before about telepresence, // and this is a really cool example // . You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, // for example, // who has an iPhone, // and her mom buys her a robot // . That girl can take her iPhone, // put it on the robot, //  send an email to Grandma, // who lives on the other side of the country // . Grandma can log into that robot // and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter / for fifteen minutes / every single night, // when otherwise / she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once / or twice a year // .
So / those are a couple of the really cool things // that Romo can do today // . But / I just want to finish by talking about something // that we're working on in the future // . This is actually something / that one of our engineers, // Dom, // built in a weekend // . It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly // . This allows you to drag / and drop these blocks of semantic code // and create any behavior for this robot you want // . You do not have to know / how to code to create a behavior for Romo // . And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, // which is what you see Romo doing on the left // . And then / if you have something you like, // you can download it onto your robot / and execute it in real life, // run the program in real life // . And then / if you have something you're proud of, // you can share it with every other person / who owns a robot in the world //. So / all of these wi-fienabled robots actually learn from each other // .
The reason / we're so focused on building robots / that everyone can train is that // we think / the most compelling use cases in personal robotics / are personal // . They change from person to person // . So / we think that // if you're going to have a robot in your home, // that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination // .
So / I wish that // I could tell you / what the future of personal robotics looks like // . To be honest, // I have no idea // . But / what we do know is that // it isn't 10 years / or 10 billion dollars / or a large humanoid robot away // . The future of personal robotics is happening today, // and it's going to depend on small, / agile robots like / Romo / and the creativity of people / like yourselves. So / we can't wait to get you all robots, // and we can't wait to see / what you build // .
When I was a child growing up in Maine, // one of my favorite things to do was / to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, // because / my parents told me // it would bring me luck //. But / you know, // these shells, // they're hard to find // . They're covered in sand, // they're difficult to see // . However, // over time, // I got used to looking for them // . I started seeing shapes / and patterns // that helped me to collect them // .
This grew into a passion for finding things, // a love for the past / and archaeology // . And eventually, // when I started studying Egyptology, // I realized that // seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough // . Because / all of the sudden, // in Egypt, // my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine / to one eight hundred miles long, // next to the Nile // . And / my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities // . This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery // . For trying to map the past, // I knew that // I had to see differently // .
So / I want to show you an example of / how we see differently using the infrared // . This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called / Mendes // . And / the site visibly appears brown, // but / when we use the infrared // and we process it, // all of the sudden, // using false color, // the site appears as bright pink // . What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape / caused by the building materials / and activities of the ancient Egyptians // .
What I want to share with you today is // how we've used satellite data / to find an ancient Egyptian city, // called Itjtawy, // missing for thousands of years // . Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, // at a period of time called / the Middle Kingdom, // about four thousand years ago // . The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, // and the site is really important, // because / in the Middle Kingdom // there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, / architecture / and religion // . Egyptologists have always known // the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings/  who built it, // indicated within the red circles here, // but somewhere within this massive flood plain // . This area is huge - //  it's four miles by three miles in size // . The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, // and as it shifted / and changed / and moved over time to the east, // it covered over the city // .
So, // how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape // ? Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of / locating a needle in a haystack, // blindfolded, // wearing baseball mitts // .
So / what we did is // we used NASA topography data / to map out the landscape, // very subtle changes // . We started to be able to see // where the Nile used to flow // . But / you can see in more detail, // and even more interesting, // this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here // which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy // .
So / we collaborated with Egyptian scientists / to do coring work, // which you see here // . When I say coring, // it's like ice coring, // but / instead of layers of climate change, // you're looking for layers of human occupation // . And, / five meters down, // underneath a thick layer of mud, // we found a dense layer of pottery // . What this shows is that // at this possible location of Itjtawy, // five meters down, // we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, // dating to the Middle Kingdom, // dating to the exact period of time / we think Itjtawy is // . We also found work stone -// carnelian, / quartz / and agate // that shows that // there was a jeweler's workshop here // . These might not look like much, // but / when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry / from the Middle Kingdom, // these are the stones / that were used // .
So, / we have a dense layer of occupation dating / to the Middle Kingdom at this site // . We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, // showing that // whatever was there / was a very important city // . No Itjtawy was here yet, // but / we're going to be returning to the site in the near future / to map it out // . And / even more importantly, // we have funding to train young Egyptians / in the use of satellite technology // so they can be the ones / making great discoveries as well // .
So / I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -//  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy / four thousand years ago // . "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings // . There's nothing like it in the land // ." So / as it turns out, // TED was not founded in 1984 AD // .
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC / at a not-lost-for-long city, // found from above // . It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective // .
Cholera was reported in Haiti / for the first time / in over 50 years last October // . There was no way to predict / how far it would spread through water supplies / and how bad the situation would get //. And / not knowing / where help was needed / always ensured that // help was in short supply in the areas / that needed it most // .
We've gotten good at predicting / and preparing for storms / before they take innocent lives / and cause irreversible damage, // but / we still can't do that with water, // and here's why // . Right now, // if you want to test water in the field, // you need a trained technician, // expensive equipment like this, // and you have to wait about a day / for chemical reactions to take place / and provide results // . It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground // before they change, // too expensive to implement in all the places // that require testing // . And / it ignores the fact that, // in the meanwhile, // people still need to drink water // . Most of the information / that we collected on the cholera outbreak / didn't come from testing water; // it came from forms like this, // which documented all the people / we failed to help // .
Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines - //  a simple / and invaluable way for miners to know / whether they're safe // . I've been inspired by that simplicity / as I've been working on this problem / with some of the most hardworking / and brilliant people / I've ever known // . We think // there's a simpler solution to this problem - // one that can be used by people // who face conditions like this everyday // .
It's in its early stages, // but / this is what it looks like right now // . We call it the Water Canary // . It's a fast, / cheap device // that answers an important question: // Is this water contaminated // ? It doesn't require any special training // . And / instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // it uses light // . That means // there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // no need to use reagents // that can run out / and no need to be an expert / to get actionable information // .
To test water, // you simply insert a sample / and, // within seconds, // it either displays a red light, // indicating contaminated water, // or a green light, // indicating the sample is safe // . This will make it possible for anyone / to collect life-saving information / and to monitor water quality conditions / as they unfold // .
We're also, // on top of that, // integrating wireless networking into an affordable device / with GPS / and GSM // . What that means is that // each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers / to be mapped in real time // . With enough users, // maps like this / will make it possible to take preventive action, // containing hazards before they turn into emergencies // that take years to recover from // . And / then, // instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people / who need it most,  // it can happen automatically // .  We've seen / how distributed networks, // big data / and information can transform society // . I think it's time for us / to apply them to water // .
Our goal over the next year is / to get Water Canary ready for the field / and to open-source the hardware // so that anyone can contribute to the development / and the evaluation, // so we can tackle this problem together // .
I collaborate with bacteria // . And / I'm about to show you / some stop-motion footage // that I made recently / where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment / over the period of an hour // .
So / what you're seeing here is / the bacteria metabolizing, // and as they do so // they create an electrical charge // . And / this attracts metals from their local environment // . And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria // .
One of the most pervasive problems in the world today / for people is // inadequate access to clean drinking water // . And / the desalination process is one / where we take out salts // . We can use it for drinking / and agriculture // . Removing the salts from water - // particularly seawater -// through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries // who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe // .
So / seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology // . We take the water from the sea // and we apply pressure // . And / this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane // . This takes energy, // producing clean water // . But / we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, / or brine //.
But / the process is very expensive // and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe // . And also, // the brine / that's produced / is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea // . And / this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area // that it's pumped back out into // .
So / I work in Singapore at the moment, // and this is a place // that's really a leading place for desalination technology // . And / Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water // . But / this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine // . And / this is where / my collaboration with bacteria comes into play // .
So / what we're doing at the moment is // we're accumulating metals like calcium, / potassium / and magnesium from out of desalination brine // . And this, // in terms of magnesium // and the amount of water / that I just mentioned, // equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore - // a place that doesn't have any natural resources // .
So / I'd like you / to image a mining industry in a way // that one hasn't existed before; // imagine a mining industry // that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; // imagine bacteria helping us do this / by accumulating / and precipitating / and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine // . And / what you can see here is / the beginning of an industry in a test tube, // a mining industry // that is in harmony with nature // .
So / this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory / four miles off the coast of Key Largo, // about 60 feet below the surface // . NASA uses this extreme environment / to train astronauts / and aquanauts, // and last year, // they invited us along for the ride // . All the footage was taken from our open ROV, // which is a robot // that we built in our garage // .
So / ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, // which in our case means // our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether / back to the computer topside // . It's open source, // meaning / we publish / and share all of our design files / and all of our code online, // allowing anyone to modify / or improve / or change the design // . It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts // and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs / James Cameron used to explore the Titanic // . So / ROVs aren't new // . They've been around for decades // . Scientists use ROVs / to explore the oceans // . Oil / and gas companies use them for exploration / and construction // . What we've built isn't unique // . It's how / we've built it / that's really unique // .
So / I want to give you a quick story of / how it got started // . So / a few years ago, // my friend Eric / and I decided // we wanted to explore this underwater cave / in the foothills of the Sierras // . We had heard this story about lost gold / from a Gold Rush-era robbery, // and we wanted to go up there // . Unfortunately, // we didn't have any money / and we didn't have any tools to do it // . So / Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, // but / we didn't have all the parts figured out, // so / we did what anybody would do in our situation: // we asked the Internet for help // . More specifically, // we created this website, // openROV.com, // and shared our intentions / and our plans / For the first few months, // it was just Eric / and I talking back to each other on the forums, // but / pretty soon, // we started to get feedback from makers / and hobbyists, // and then / actually professional ocean engineers / who had some suggestions for what we should do // . We kept working on it // . We learned a lot // . We kept prototyping, // and eventually, // we decided we wanted to go to the cave // . We were ready // .
So / about that time, // our little expedition became quite a story, // and it got picked up in The New York Times // . And / we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people // who wanted a kit / that they could build this open ROV themselves // .
So / we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, // and when we did, // we raised our funding goal in about two hours, // and all of a sudden, // had this money to make these kits // . But / then / we had to learn / how to make them // . I mean, // we had to learn small batch manufacturing // . So / we quickly learned that // our garage was not big enough / to hold our growing operation // . But / we were able to do it, // we got all the kits made, // thanks a lot to TechShop, // which was a big help to us, // and we shipped these kits all over the world / just before Christmas of last year, // so it was just a few months ago // . But / we're already starting to get video / and photos back from all over the world, // including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica // . We've also learned the penguins love robots // . 
So / we're still publishing all the designs online, // encouraging anyone to build these themselves // . That's the only way // that we could have done this // . By being open source, // we've created this distributed R&D network, // and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart // . But / the actual robot is really only half the story // . The real potential, // the long term potential, // is with this community of DIY ocean explorers // that are forming all over the globe // . What can we discover // when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas // ?
So / you're probably all wondering: // the cave // . Did you find the gold // ? Well, // we didn't find any gold, // but / we decided that // what we found was much more valuable // . It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration // . It's something / that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, // but / something / that we're all participating in // . It's an underwater world / we're all exploring together // .
The universe is teeming with planets // .  I want us, // in the next decade, // to build a space telescope / that'll be able to image an Earth about another star / and figure out whether it can harbor life //.  My colleagues at / the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton // and I are working on technology // that will be able to do just that in the coming years // .  Astronomers now believe that // every star in the galaxy has a planet, // and they speculate that // up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet // that might be able to harbor life, // but / we haven't seen any of them // .  We've only detected them indirectly // .
This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot // . It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990, // when they turned it around / as it was exiting the solar system / to take a picture of the Earth / from six billion kilometers away. // I want to take that of an Earth-like planet about another star // .
Why haven't we done that // ? Why is that hard // ? Well to see, // let's imagine // we take the Hubble Space Telescope / and we turn it around / and we move it out to the orbit of Mars // . We'll see something like that, // a slightly blurry picture of the Earth, // because / we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars //.  Now / let's move ten times further away //. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus // .  It's gotten smaller, // it's got less detail, // less resolve //. We can still see the little moon, // but / let's go ten times further away again // . Here / we are at the edge of the solar system, // out at the Kuiper Belt // . Now / it's not resolved at all //. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's //. But / let's move yet again ten times further away //. Here / we are out at the Oort Cloud, // outside the solar system, // and we're starting to see the sun / move into the field of view / and get into where the planet is // . One more time, // ten times further away // . Now / we're at Alpha Centauri, // our nearest neighbor star, // and the planet is gone // . All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star // that's ten billion times brighter than the planet, // which should be in that little red circle //. That's what we want to see //. That's why it's hard //. The light from the star is diffracting //. It's scattering inside the telescope, // creating that very bright image / that washes out the planet //. 
So / to see the planet, // we have to do something about all of that light // . We have to get rid of it // . I have a lot of colleagues / working on really amazing technologies to do that, // but / I want to tell you about one today // that I think is the coolest, // and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade // .
It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer, // the father of the space telescope, // in 1962, // and he took his inspiration from an eclipse // . You've all seen that //. That's a solar eclipse // . The moon has moved in front of the sun //. It blocks out most of the light // so we can see that dim corona around it // . It would be the same thing // if I put my thumb up / and blocked that spotlight / that's getting right in my eye, // I can see you in the back row // . Well, // what's going on // ? Well / the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth // . We put a telescope / or a camera in that shadow, // we look back at the sun, // and most of the light's been removed // and we can see that dim, / fine structure in the corona //. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space // . We build a big screen, // we fly it in space, // we put it up in front of the star, // we block out most of the light, // we fly a space telescope in that shadow // that's created, // and boom, // we get to see planets // . Well / that would look something like this // . So / there's that big screen, // and there's no planets, // because / unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well, // because / the light waves of the light / and waves diffracts around that screen / the same way it did in the telescope // . It's like water bending around a rock in a stream, // and all that light just destroys the shadow // . It's a terrible shadow //. And we can't see planets //.
But / Spitzer actually knew the answer // . If we can feather the edges, // soften those edges / so we can control diffraction, // well then we can see a planet, // and in the last 10 years / or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that // . It looks something like that // . We call that our flower petal starshade //. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right, // if we control their shape, // we can control diffraction, // and now / we have a great shadow //. It's about 10 billion times dimmer / than it was before, // and we can see the planets beam out just like that // . That, // of course, // has to be bigger than my thumb // . That starshade is about the size of half a football field // and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope / that has to be held right in its shadow, // and then / we can see those planets // .
This sounds formidable, // but / brilliant engineers, / colleagues of mine at JPL, // came up with a fabulous design for / how to do that / and it looks like this // . It starts wrapped around a hub // . It separates from the telescope // . The petals unfurl, // they open up, // the telescope turns around //. Then you'll see it flip / and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope // . It's going to move in front of the star just like that, // creates a wonderful shadow // . Boom, // we get planets orbiting about it // . (Applause) Thank you //.
That's not science fiction // . We've been working on this / for the last five / or six years //. Last summer, we did a really cool test out in California / at Northrop Grumman // . So / those are four petals //. This is a sub-scale star shade // . It's about half the size of the one you just saw // . You'll see the petals unfurl //. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates / doing a summer internship at JPL // . Now / you're seeing it deploy // . Those petals have to rotate into place // . The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time / to within a tenth of a millimeter // . We ran this test 16 times, // and 16 times / it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter // . This has to be done very precisely, // but / if we can do this, // if we can build this technology, // if we can get it into space, // you might see something like this //. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars / taken with the Hubble Space Telescope // . If we can take a similar space telescope, // slightly larger, //put it out there, // fly an occulter in front of it, // what we might see is / something like that // -- that's a family portrait of our solar system // -- but / not ours //.  We're hoping / it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter, // through a starshade like that //. You can see Jupiter, // you can see Saturn, // Uranus, // Neptune, // and right there in the center, // next to the residual light / is that pale blue dot //. That's Earth // . We want to see that, // see if there's water, // oxygen, // ozone, // the things that might tell us that // it could harbor life // .
I think // this is the coolest possible science // . That's why I got into doing this, // because / I think // that will change the world // . That will change everything / when we see that // .
So / what I want to try to do is / tell a quick story about a 404 page / and a lesson // that was learned as a result of it // . But / to start it probably / helps to have an understanding of / what a 404 page actually is // .
The 404 page is that // . It's that broken experience on the Web // . It's effectively the default page // when you ask a website for something // and it can't find it // . And / it serves you the 404 page // . It's inherently a feeling of being broken // when you go through it // . And / I just want you to think a little bit about, // remember for yourself, // it's annoying / when you hit this thing // . Because / it's the feeling of a broken relationship // .
And / that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, // where does 404 come from // ? It's from a family of errors actually - // a whole set of relationship errors, // which, // when I started digging into them, // it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist / or a couples counselor // . You sort of get down there to the bottom // and things get really dicey // .
But / these things are everywhere // . They're on sites big, // they're on sites small // . This is a global experience //.
What a 404 page tells you is that // you fell through the cracks // . And / that's not a good experience / when you're used to experiences like this // . You can get on your Kinect // and you can have unicorns dancing / and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone // . A 404 page is not what  you're looking for // . You get that, // and it's like a slap in the face // . Trying to think about / how a 404 felt, // and it would be like / if you went to Starbucks // and there's the guy behind the counter // and you're over there // and there's no skim milk // . And / you say, // "Hey, // could you bring the skim milk // ?" And / they walk out from behind the counter // and they've got no pants on // . And / you're like, // "Oh, // I didn't want to see that // ." That's the 404 feeling // .
So / where this comes into play // and why this is important is / I head up a technology incubator, // and we had eight startups sitting around there // . And / those startups are focused on what they are, // not what they're not, // until one day Athletepath, // which is a website / that focuses on services for extreme athletes, / found this video //.
Renny Gleeson: // You just ... // no, // he's not okay // . They took that video // and they embedded it in their 404 page // and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place // . Because / finally there was a page / that actually felt like / what it felt like to hit a 404 // .
So / this turned into a contest // . Dailypath / that offers inspiration / put inspiration on their 404 page // . Stayhound, // which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, // commiserated with your pet // . Each one of them found this // . It turned into a 24-hour contest // . At 4:04 the next day, // we gave out $404 in cash // . And / what they learned was that // those little things, // done right, // actually matter, // and that well-designed moments can build brands // . So / you take a look out in the real world, // and the fun thing is / you can actually hack these yourself // . You can type in an URL // and put in a 404 // and these will pop // . This is one // that commiserates with you // . This is one // that blames you // . This is one // that I loved // . This is an error page, // but / what if this error page was also an opportunity // ?
So / it was a moment in time // where all of these startups had to sit / and think / and got really excited about what they could be // . Because / back to the whole relationship issue, // what they figured out through this exercise was that // a simple mistake can tell me / what you're not, // or it can remind me of / why I should love you // .
Ladies / and gentlemen, // gather around // . I would love to share with you a story // .
Once upon a time / in 19th century Germany, // there was the book // . Now / during this time, // the book was the king of storytelling // . It was venerable // . It was ubiquitous // . But it was a little bit boring // . Because / in its 400 years of existence, // storytellers never evolved the book / as a storytelling device // . But / then / one author arrived, // and he changed the game forever // .  His name was Lothar, // Lothar Meggendorfer // . Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, // and he said, // "Genug ist genug! // " He grabbed his pen, // he snatched his scissors // . This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy / and just decided to fold // . History would know / Lothar Meggendorfer as -- / who else // ? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book // .  For this delight / and for this wonder, // people rejoiced // .  They were happy // because / the story survived, // and that // the world would keep on spinning // .
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way / a story was told, // and he certainly wasn't the last // . Whether storytellers realized it / or not, // they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit / when they moved opera to vaudville, // radio news to radio theater, // film to film in motion / to film in sound, // color, // 3D, // on VHS / and on DVD // . There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis // .
And / things got a lot more fun // when the Internet came around // .  Because, // not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, // but / they could do so / using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices // . For example, // one company would tell a story of love / through its very own search engine // . One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D // . And / one man would tell the stories of his father / by using a platform called Twitter / to communicate the excrement / his father would gesticulate // .
And / after all this, // everyone paused; // they took a step back // . They realized that, // in 6,000 years of storytelling, // they've gone from depicting / hunting on cave walls / to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls // . And / this was a cause for celebration // . The art of storytelling has remained unchanged // . And / for the most part, // the stories are recycled // . But / the way / that humans tell the stories  / has always evolved with pure, / consistent novelty // .
And / they remembered a man, // one amazing German, // every time a new storytelling device popped up next // . And for that, // the audience --//  the lovely, / beautiful audience --//  would live happily ever after // . 

As a kid, // I was fascinated with all things air / and space // . I would watch Nova on PBS // . Our school would show Bill Nye / the Science Guy // . When I was in elementary school, // my next door neighbor, // he gave me a book for my birthday // . It was an astronomy book, // and I poured over that thing for hours on end, // and it was a combination of all these things // that inspired me to pursue space exploration / as my own personal dream, // and part of that dream was, // I always wanted to just fly around the solar system // and visit different planets // and visit moons // and spacecraft // .
Well, // a number of years later, // I graduated from UCLA // and I found myself at NASA, // working for the jet propulsion laboratory, // and there / our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system, // and today / I want to show you what we've done so far // .
Now, // the kicker is, // everything I'm about to do here / you can do at home, // because / we built this for the public for you guys to use //.
So / what you're looking at right now is the Earth // . You can see the United States / and California / and San Diego, // and you can use the mouse / or the keyboard to spin things around // .
Now, // this isn't new // . Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before, // but / one thing we like to say in our group is, // we do the opposite of Google Earth // . Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard // . We go from this view out to the stars // . So / the Earth is cool, // but / what we really want to show are the spacecraft, // so I'm going to bring the interface back up, // and now / you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth // . These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters // . We haven't included military satellites / and weather satellites / and communication satellites / and reconnaissance satellites // . If we did, // it would be a complete mess, // because / there's a lot of stuff out there // . And the cool thing is, // we actually created 3D models / for a number of these spacecraft, // so / if you want to visit any of these, // all you need to do is double-click on them // .
So / I'm going to find the International Space Station, // double-click, // and it will take us all the way down to the ISS // . And now / you're riding along with the ISS / where it is right now //.
And / the other cool thing is, // not only can we move the camera around, // we can also control time, // so / I can slide this jog dial here / to shuttle time forward, // and now / we can see / what a sunset on the ISS would look like, // and they get one every 90 minutes // . (Laughter)
All right, // so what about the rest of it // ? Well, // I can click on this home button over here, // and that will take us up to the inner solar system, // and now / we're looking at the rest of the solar system // . You can see, // there's Saturn, // there's Jupiter, // and while we're here, // I want to point out something // . It's actually pretty busy // .
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory / on its way to Mars, // just launched last weekend //.
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, // there // . We have Dawn orbiting Vesta, // and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto //.
And / I mention this // because / there's this strange public perception // that NASA's dead, // that the space shuttles stopped flying // and all of the sudden // there's no more spacecraft out there // .
Well, // a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration, // and we have a lot of spacecraft out there // . Granted, // we're not sending humans up at the moment, // well at least with our own launch vehicles, // but / NASA is far from dead, // and one of the reasons / why we write a program like this is // so that / people realize that // there's so many other things / that we're doing //.
Anyway, // while we're here, // again, // if you want to visit anything, // all you need to do is double-click. // So / I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, // and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, // and this is happening right now // . I'm going to double-click on Uranus, // and we can see Uranus rotating on its side / along with its moons // . You can see / how it's tilted at about 89 degrees // .
And / just being able to visit different places / and go through different times, // we have data from 1950 to 2050 // . Granted, // we don't have everything in between, // because / some of the data is hard to get // . Just being able to visit places in different times, // you can explore this for hours, // literally hours on end, // but / I want to show you one thing in particular, // so I'm going to open up the destination tab, // spacecraft outer planet missions, // Voyager 1, // and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby // . So now / we've gone back in time // . We're now riding along with Voyager 1 // . The date here is November 11, / 1980 // .
Now, / there's a funny thing going on here // . It doesn't look like anything's going on // . It looks like / I've paused the program // . It's actually running at real rate right now, // one second per second, // and in fact, // Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan / at I think / it's 38,000 miles per hour // . It only looks like nothing's moving because, // well, // Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, // and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away // . It's just the vastness of space / makes it look like nothing's happening // .
But / to make it more interesting, // I'm going to speed up time, // and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan, // which is a hazy moon of Saturn // . It actually has a very thick atmosphere // . And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, // here //.  I'm going to pull out, // and I want to show you Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn // .
There's a point to be made here //.  With a 3D visualization like this, // we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn // . There's a whole story to tell here // . And even better, // because / it's an interactive application, // you can tell the story for yourself. // If you want to pause it, // you can pause it. // If you want to keep going, // if you want to change the camera angle, // you can do that, // and because of that, // I can show you that / Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn // . It actually flies underneath Saturn // . Now, // what happens is, // as it flies underneath Saturn, // Saturn grabs it gravitationally / and flings it up / and out of the solar system, // so if I just keep letting this go, // you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that // . And, // in fact, // I'm going to go back to the solar system // . I'm going to go back to today, // now, // and I want to show you / where Voyager 1 is // . Right there, // above, // way above the solar system, // way beyond our solar system //.
And / here's the thing // . Now you know / how it got there // . Now you know why, // and to me, // that's the point of this program // . You can manipulate it yourself // . You can fly around yourself // and you can learn for yourself // .
You know, // the theme today is // "The World In Your Grasp // ."  Well, // we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp //  (Laughter)  and we hope / once it's there, // you'll be able to learn for yourself // what we've done out there, // and what we're about to do // . And my personal dream is / for kids to take this / and explore / and see the wonders out there / and be inspired, // as I was as a kid, // to pursue STEM education / and to pursue a dream in space exploration //.
