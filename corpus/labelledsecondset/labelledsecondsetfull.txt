I came here to show you the Fotokite // . It's a tethered, / flying camera //. But / before I do that, // I want to tell you a bit / about where it came from, // what motivated it //.
So / I was born in Russia, // and three years ago, // in 2011, // there were the Russian federal elections //. There were massive irregularities reported, // and people came out to protest, // which was very unlikely for Russia //. And no one really knew / how significant these protests were, // because, // for whatever reason, // the world media largely ignored it //. Now, // there was a group of photographers // who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby // — usually photographing things like the Sphinx, // the Pyramids // — who happened to be right around the corner, // and they flew a camera // and they took some snapshots, // some panoramas of this demonstration // .  Just completely independent entity, // completely random occurrence, // and the image, // when I saw it, // it really struck me //. Here's one of the panoramas // . So in a single image, // you can really see the scale of this event // — just the number of people, // the colors, // the banners // . You just can't consider this insignificant // . All in a single image, // which was really cool to me // .
And I think, // in the future, // journalism / and many other professions, // there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there, // but / I think, // you wait a few months, // a few years, // and for many professions, // it's really going to be a requirement // .
And it make sense // . It's such a unique perspective // . Nothing really communicates this scale, // for example, // in context, // in a way that this does // . But / there are a few hurdles, // and they are quite basic / and quite fundamental // .
One is piloting // . So / for this image, // they flew a camera, // a five kilogram device with an SLR under it // . It's quite heavy, // lots of spinning, // sharp things // . It's a bit uncomfortable to fly, // probably also for the operator // . In fact, // you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, // it says,  // "No questions until landing" // in Russian / and in English, // because / people are curious, // and they'll go tap you, // and then / you lose your focus / and things happen // . And these guys are great // . They're professionals; // they're really careful in what they do // . So / in the protests, // maybe you noticed, // they flew over the river / so it was quite safe // . But / this doesn't necessarily apply to all people / and all conditions, // so we really have to make piloting easier // .
The other problem is regulations, // or rather,  // the lack of good regulation // . For many good reasons, // it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws / to regulate flying cameras //.  So we already have cameras // . Everyone here, // I'm sure, // has a smartphone with a camera, // right // ? There are more and more of them // . You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked // . You hear about, // actually, // a drone pilot, // a hobbyist, // was attacked two weeks ago // because / he was flying near a beach // . Here's some personal input / I didn't expect // . Just yesterday, // I was attacked by a guy // who claimed that / I was filming him // . I was checking my email right here — // easy way to get input for your talk  // . But I think there are better solutions // . I think we have to defuse the situation // . We have to come up with responsible solutions // that address the privacy issues / and the safety, / accountability issues // but / still give us that perspective // .
And this is one potential solution // . So this is the Fotokite // . Well, // let me see, // it's a quadrocopter, // but / what's kind of special about it is / there's a leash // . It's literally a dog leash // . It's very convenient // . And / the neat thing about it is, // to fly it, // there's no joysticks, // nothing like this // . You just turn it on // and you point in the direction / that you want to fly // . You give it a little twist //. That's kind of the way / you communicate //. And there it goes // .
So / the interaction is super simple // . It's like a personal flying pet // . It just always maintains a certain angle to you, // and if I move around with it, // it'll actually follow me naturally // . And of course, // we can build on top of this // . So / this leash has some additional electronics // . You can turn it on // . And now, // it's like telling your dog to fly lower, // if you have such a dog // . So, /  I can press a button / and manipulate it rather easily // . So / I just shifted its position // .
And / it's really safe // . I don't know about you guys in the front row — // (Laughter) — // but / at least in principle, // you have to agree that // you feel safer // because / there is a physical connection // . Live demos are hard, // right // ? Things go wrong all the time // . But / no matter what, // this thing will actually prevent this thing / from going into you // . What's more, // it tells you immediately that // I am the one responsible for this device // . You don't have to look for someone controlling it //.
Now, // I can tell you that it's easy a lot, // but / I think a really good way to prove that is // to grab a second one / and launch it // .  And / if I can do this on stage live, // then / I can show each / and every one of you in five minutes / how to operate one of these devices // .
So now / we have two eyes in the sky // .  And now / the trick is getting them back // . 
So / my question now to you is, // well, // it's a nice solution, // it's very accessible, // it's safe // . What would you use it for // ? What would you use such a camera for in your life // ?
So / just by a show of hands, // how many of you all have a robot at home // ? Not very many of you // . Okay // . And actually of those hands, // if you don't include Roomba // how many of you have a robot at home // ? So a couple // . That's okay // . That's the problem that // we're trying to solve at Romotive --//  that I / and the other 20 nerds at Romotive / are obsessed with solving // .
So / we really want to build a robot // that anyone can use, // whether you're eight / or 80 // . And as it turns out, // that's a really hard problem, // because you have to build a small, / portable robot // that's not only really affordable, // but / it has to be something // that people actually want to take home / and have around their kids // . This robot can't be creepy / or uncanny // . He should be friendly / and cute // .
So / meet Romo // . Romo's a robot // that uses a device / you already know / and love -- // your iPhone -- as his brain //. And / by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor, // we can create a robot // that is wi-fi enabled // and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks, // which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past // .
When Romo wakes up, // he's in creature mode // . So / he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face // . If I duck down, // he'll follow me // . He's wary, // so he'll keep his eyes on me // . If I come over here, // he'll turn to follow me // . If I come over here -- // He's smart // . And / if I get too close to him, // he gets scared just like / any other creature // . So / in a lot of ways, // Romo is like a pet // that has a mind of his own // . Thanks, // little guy // .  Bless you // .
And / if I want to explore the world -- // uh-oh, // Romo's tired -- //  if I want to explore the world with Romo, //  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device // . So / here's the iPad // . And Romo will actually stream video to this device // . So / I can see everything / that Romo sees, // and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world // . Now / this is a free app on the App Store, // so / if any of you guys had this app on your phones, // we could literally right now share control of the robot / and play games together // .
So / I'll show you really quickly, // Romo actually  -// he's streaming video, // so you can see me / and the entire TED audience // . If I get in front of Romo here // . And / if I want to control him, // I can just drive // . So / I can drive him around, // and I can take pictures of you // . I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience // . So / I'll snap a picture // . And in the same way // that you scroll through content on an iPad, // I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device // . So / there are all of you through Romo's eyes // . And finally, // because / Romo is an extension of me, // I can express myself through his emotions // . So / I can go in // and I can say / let's make Romo excited //.
But / the most important thing about Romo is that // we wanted to create something // that was literally completely intuitive // . You do not have to teach someone / how to drive Romo // . In fact, // who would like to drive a robot // ? Okay // . Awesome // . Here you go // . Thank you, // Scott //.
And even cooler, // you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot / to control him //. So / he actually streams two-way audio / and video between any two smart devices // . So / you can log in through the browser, // and it's kind of like Skype on wheels // . So / we were talking before about telepresence, // and this is a really cool example // . You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, // for example, // who has an iPhone, // and her mom buys her a robot // . That girl can take her iPhone, // put it on the robot, //  send an email to Grandma, // who lives on the other side of the country // . Grandma can log into that robot // and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter / for fifteen minutes / every single night, // when otherwise / she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once / or twice a year // .
So / those are a couple of the really cool things // that Romo can do today // . But / I just want to finish by talking about something // that we're working on in the future // . This is actually something / that one of our engineers, // Dom, // built in a weekend // . It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly // . This allows you to drag / and drop these blocks of semantic code // and create any behavior for this robot you want // . You do not have to know / how to code to create a behavior for Romo // . And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, // which is what you see Romo doing on the left // . And then / if you have something you like, // you can download it onto your robot / and execute it in real life, // run the program in real life // . And then / if you have something you're proud of, // you can share it with every other person / who owns a robot in the world //. So / all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other // .
The reason / we're so focused on building robots / that everyone can train is that // we think / the most compelling use cases in personal robotics / are personal // . They change from person to person // . So / we think that // if you're going to have a robot in your home, // that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination // .
So / I wish that // I could tell you / what the future of personal robotics looks like // . To be honest, // I have no idea // . But / what we do know is that // it isn't 10 years / or 10 billion dollars / or a large humanoid robot away // . The future of personal robotics is happening today, // and it's going to depend on small, / agile robots like / Romo / and the creativity of people / like yourselves. So / we can't wait to get you all robots, // and we can't wait to see / what you build // .
When I was a child growing up in Maine, // one of my favorite things to do was / to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, // because / my parents told me // it would bring me luck //. But / you know, // these shells, // they're hard to find // . They're covered in sand, // they're difficult to see // . However, // over time, // I got used to looking for them // . I started seeing shapes / and patterns // that helped me to collect them // .
This grew into a passion for finding things, // a love for the past / and archaeology // . And eventually, // when I started studying Egyptology, // I realized that // seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough // . Because / all of the sudden, // in Egypt, // my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine / to one eight hundred miles long, // next to the Nile // . And / my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities // . This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery // . For trying to map the past, // I knew that // I had to see differently // .
So / I want to show you an example of / how we see differently using the infrared // . This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called / Mendes // . And / the site visibly appears brown, // but / when we use the infrared // and we process it, // all of the sudden, // using false color, // the site appears as bright pink // . What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape / caused by the building materials / and activities of the ancient Egyptians // .
What I want to share with you today is // how we've used satellite data / to find an ancient Egyptian city, // called Itjtawy, // missing for thousands of years // . Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, // at a period of time called / the Middle Kingdom, // about four thousand years ago // . The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, // and the site is really important, // because / in the Middle Kingdom // there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, / architecture / and religion // . Egyptologists have always known // the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings/  who built it, // indicated within the red circles here, // but somewhere within this massive flood plain // . This area is huge - //  it's four miles by three miles in size // . The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, // and as it shifted / and changed / and moved over time to the east, // it covered over the city // .
So, // how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape // ? Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of / locating a needle in a haystack, // blindfolded, // wearing baseball mitts // .
So / what we did is // we used NASA topography data / to map out the landscape, // very subtle changes // . We started to be able to see // where the Nile used to flow // . But / you can see in more detail, // and even more interesting, // this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here // which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy // .
So / we collaborated with Egyptian scientists / to do coring work, // which you see here // . When I say coring, // it's like ice coring, // but / instead of layers of climate change, // you're looking for layers of human occupation // . And, / five meters down, // underneath a thick layer of mud, // we found a dense layer of pottery // . What this shows is that // at this possible location of Itjtawy, // five meters down, // we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, // dating to the Middle Kingdom, // dating to the exact period of time / we think Itjtawy is // . We also found work stone -// carnelian, / quartz / and agate // that shows that // there was a jeweler's workshop here // . These might not look like much, // but / when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry / from the Middle Kingdom, // these are the stones / that were used // .
So, / we have a dense layer of occupation dating / to the Middle Kingdom at this site // . We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, // showing that // whatever was there / was a very important city // . No Itjtawy was here yet, // but / we're going to be returning to the site in the near future / to map it out // . And / even more importantly, // we have funding to train young Egyptians / in the use of satellite technology // so they can be the ones / making great discoveries as well // .
So / I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -//  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy / four thousand years ago // . "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings // . There's nothing like it in the land // ." So / as it turns out, // TED was not founded in 1984 AD // .
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC / at a not-lost-for-long city, // found from above // . It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective // .
Cholera was reported in Haiti / for the first time / in over 50 years last October // . There was no way to predict / how far it would spread through water supplies / and how bad the situation would get //. And / not knowing / where help was needed / always ensured that // help was in short supply in the areas / that needed it most // .
We've gotten good at predicting / and preparing for storms / before they take innocent lives / and cause irreversible damage, // but / we still can't do that with water, // and here's why // . Right now, // if you want to test water in the field, // you need a trained technician, // expensive equipment like this, // and you have to wait about a day / for chemical reactions to take place / and provide results // . It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground // before they change, // too expensive to implement in all the places // that require testing // . And / it ignores the fact that, // in the meanwhile, // people still need to drink water // . Most of the information / that we collected on the cholera outbreak / didn't come from testing water; // it came from forms like this, // which documented all the people / we failed to help // .
Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines - //  a simple / and invaluable way for miners to know / whether they're safe // . I've been inspired by that simplicity / as I've been working on this problem / with some of the most hardworking / and brilliant people / I've ever known // . We think // there's a simpler solution to this problem - // one that can be used by people // who face conditions like this everyday // .
It's in its early stages, // but / this is what it looks like right now // . We call it the Water Canary // . It's a fast, / cheap device // that answers an important question: // Is this water contaminated // ? It doesn't require any special training // . And / instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // it uses light // . That means // there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // no need to use reagents // that can run out / and no need to be an expert / to get actionable information // .
To test water, // you simply insert a sample / and, // within seconds, // it either displays a red light, // indicating contaminated water, // or a green light, // indicating the sample is safe // . This will make it possible for anyone / to collect life-saving information / and to monitor water quality conditions / as they unfold // .
We're also, // on top of that, // integrating wireless networking into an affordable device / with GPS / and GSM // . What that means is that // each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers / to be mapped in real time // . With enough users, // maps like this / will make it possible to take preventive action, // containing hazards before they turn into emergencies // that take years to recover from // . And / then, // instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people / who need it most,  // it can happen automatically // .  We've seen / how distributed networks, // big data / and information can transform society // . I think it's time for us / to apply them to water // .
Our goal over the next year is / to get Water Canary ready for the field / and to open-source the hardware // so that anyone can contribute to the development / and the evaluation, // so we can tackle this problem together // .
I collaborate with bacteria // . And / I'm about to show you / some stop-motion footage // that I made recently / where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment / over the period of an hour // .
So / what you're seeing here is / the bacteria metabolizing, // and as they do so // they create an electrical charge // . And / this attracts metals from their local environment // . And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria // .
One of the most pervasive problems in the world today / for people is // inadequate access to clean drinking water // . And / the desalination process is one / where we take out salts // . We can use it for drinking / and agriculture // . Removing the salts from water - // particularly seawater -// through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries // who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe // .
So / seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology // . We take the water from the sea // and we apply pressure // . And / this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane // . This takes energy, // producing clean water // . But / we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, / or brine //.
But / the process is very expensive // and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe // . And also, // the brine / that's produced / is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea // . And / this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area // that it's pumped back out into // .
So / I work in Singapore at the moment, // and this is a place // that's really a leading place for desalination technology // . And / Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water // . But / this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine // . And / this is where / my collaboration with bacteria comes into play // .
So / what we're doing at the moment is // we're accumulating metals like calcium, / potassium / and magnesium from out of desalination brine // . And this, // in terms of magnesium // and the amount of water / that I just mentioned, // equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore - // a place that doesn't have any natural resources // .
So / I'd like you / to image a mining industry in a way // that one hasn't existed before; // imagine a mining industry // that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; // imagine bacteria helping us do this / by accumulating / and precipitating / and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine // . And / what you can see here is / the beginning of an industry in a test tube, // a mining industry // that is in harmony with nature // .
So / this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory / four miles off the coast of Key Largo, // about 60 feet below the surface // . NASA uses this extreme environment / to train astronauts / and aquanauts, // and last year, // they invited us along for the ride // . All the footage was taken from our open ROV, // which is a robot // that we built in our garage // .
So / ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, // which in our case means // our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether / back to the computer topside // . It's open source, // meaning / we publish / and share all of our design files / and all of our code online, // allowing anyone to modify / or improve / or change the design // . It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts // and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs / James Cameron used to explore the Titanic // . So / ROVs aren't new // . They've been around for decades // . Scientists use ROVs / to explore the oceans // . Oil / and gas companies use them for exploration / and construction // . What we've built isn't unique // . It's how / we've built it / that's really unique // .
So / I want to give you a quick story of / how it got started // . So / a few years ago, // my friend Eric / and I decided // we wanted to explore this underwater cave / in the foothills of the Sierras // . We had heard this story about lost gold / from a Gold Rush-era robbery, // and we wanted to go up there // . Unfortunately, // we didn't have any money / and we didn't have any tools to do it // . So / Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, // but / we didn't have all the parts figured out, // so / we did what anybody would do in our situation: // we asked the Internet for help // . More specifically, // we created this website, // openROV.com, // and shared our intentions / and our plans / For the first few months, // it was just Eric / and I talking back to each other on the forums, // but / pretty soon, // we started to get feedback from makers / and hobbyists, // and then / actually professional ocean engineers / who had some suggestions for what we should do // . We kept working on it // . We learned a lot // . We kept prototyping, // and eventually, // we decided we wanted to go to the cave // . We were ready // .
So / about that time, // our little expedition became quite a story, // and it got picked up in The New York Times // . And / we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people // who wanted a kit / that they could build this open ROV themselves // .
So / we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, // and when we did, // we raised our funding goal in about two hours, // and all of a sudden, // had this money to make these kits // . But / then / we had to learn / how to make them // . I mean, // we had to learn small batch manufacturing // . So / we quickly learned that // our garage was not big enough / to hold our growing operation // . But / we were able to do it, // we got all the kits made, // thanks a lot to TechShop, // which was a big help to us, // and we shipped these kits all over the world / just before Christmas of last year, // so it was just a few months ago // . But / we're already starting to get video / and photos back from all over the world, // including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica // . We've also learned the penguins love robots // . 
So / we're still publishing all the designs online, // encouraging anyone to build these themselves // . That's the only way // that we could have done this // . By being open source, // we've created this distributed R&D network, // and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart // . But / the actual robot is really only half the story // . The real potential, // the long term potential, // is with this community of DIY ocean explorers // that are forming all over the globe // . What can we discover // when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas // ?
So / you're probably all wondering: // the cave // . Did you find the gold // ? Well, // we didn't find any gold, // but / we decided that // what we found was much more valuable // . It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration // . It's something / that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, // but / something / that we're all participating in // . It's an underwater world / we're all exploring together // .
The universe is teeming with planets // .  I want us, // in the next decade, // to build a space telescope / that'll be able to image an Earth about another star / and figure out whether it can harbor life //.  My colleagues at / the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton // and I are working on technology // that will be able to do just that in the coming years // .  Astronomers now believe that // every star in the galaxy has a planet, // and they speculate that // up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet // that might be able to harbor life, // but / we haven't seen any of them // .  We've only detected them indirectly // .
This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot // . It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990, // when they turned it around / as it was exiting the solar system / to take a picture of the Earth / from six billion kilometers away. // I want to take that of an Earth-like planet about another star // .
Why haven't we done that // ? Why is that hard // ? Well to see, // let's imagine // we take the Hubble Space Telescope / and we turn it around / and we move it out to the orbit of Mars // . We'll see something like that, // a slightly blurry picture of the Earth, // because / we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars //.  Now / let's move ten times further away //. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus // .  It's gotten smaller, // it's got less detail, // less resolve //. We can still see the little moon, // but / let's go ten times further away again // . Here / we are at the edge of the solar system, // out at the Kuiper Belt // . Now / it's not resolved at all //. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's //. But / let's move yet again ten times further away //. Here / we are out at the Oort Cloud, // outside the solar system, // and we're starting to see the sun / move into the field of view / and get into where the planet is // . One more time, // ten times further away // . Now / we're at Alpha Centauri, // our nearest neighbor star, // and the planet is gone // . All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star // that's ten billion times brighter than the planet, // which should be in that little red circle //. That's what we want to see //. That's why it's hard //. The light from the star is diffracting //. It's scattering inside the telescope, // creating that very bright image / that washes out the planet //. 
So / to see the planet, // we have to do something about all of that light // . We have to get rid of it // . I have a lot of colleagues / working on really amazing technologies to do that, // but / I want to tell you about one today // that I think is the coolest, // and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade // .
It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer, // the father of the space telescope, // in 1962, // and he took his inspiration from an eclipse // . You've all seen that //. That's a solar eclipse // . The moon has moved in front of the sun //. It blocks out most of the light // so we can see that dim corona around it // . It would be the same thing // if I put my thumb up / and blocked that spotlight / that's getting right in my eye, // I can see you in the back row // . Well, // what's going on // ? Well / the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth // . We put a telescope / or a camera in that shadow, // we look back at the sun, // and most of the light's been removed // and we can see that dim, / fine structure in the corona //. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space // . We build a big screen, // we fly it in space, // we put it up in front of the star, // we block out most of the light, // we fly a space telescope in that shadow // that's created, // and boom, // we get to see planets // . Well / that would look something like this // . So / there's that big screen, // and there's no planets, // because / unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well, // because / the light waves of the light / and waves diffracts around that screen / the same way it did in the telescope // . It's like water bending around a rock in a stream, // and all that light just destroys the shadow // . It's a terrible shadow //. And we can't see planets //.
But / Spitzer actually knew the answer // . If we can feather the edges, // soften those edges / so we can control diffraction, // well then we can see a planet, // and in the last 10 years / or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that // . It looks something like that // . We call that our flower petal starshade //. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right, // if we control their shape, // we can control diffraction, // and now / we have a great shadow //. It's about 10 billion times dimmer / than it was before, // and we can see the planets beam out just like that // . That, // of course, // has to be bigger than my thumb // . That starshade is about the size of half a football field // and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope / that has to be held right in its shadow, // and then / we can see those planets // .
This sounds formidable, // but / brilliant engineers, / colleagues of mine at JPL, // came up with a fabulous design for / how to do that / and it looks like this // . It starts wrapped around a hub // . It separates from the telescope // . The petals unfurl, // they open up, // the telescope turns around //. Then you'll see it flip / and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope // . It's going to move in front of the star just like that, // creates a wonderful shadow // . Boom, // we get planets orbiting about it // . (Applause) Thank you //.
That's not science fiction // . We've been working on this / for the last five / or six years //. Last summer, we did a really cool test out in California / at Northrop Grumman // . So / those are four petals //. This is a sub-scale star shade // . It's about half the size of the one you just saw // . You'll see the petals unfurl //. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates / doing a summer internship at JPL // . Now / you're seeing it deploy // . Those petals have to rotate into place // . The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time / to within a tenth of a millimeter // . We ran this test 16 times, // and 16 times / it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter // . This has to be done very precisely, // but / if we can do this, // if we can build this technology, // if we can get it into space, // you might see something like this //. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars / taken with the Hubble Space Telescope // . If we can take a similar space telescope, // slightly larger, //put it out there, // fly an occulter in front of it, // what we might see is / something like that // -- that's a family portrait of our solar system // -- but / not ours //.  We're hoping / it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter, // through a starshade like that //. You can see Jupiter, // you can see Saturn, // Uranus, // Neptune, // and right there in the center, // next to the residual light / is that pale blue dot //. That's Earth // . We want to see that, // see if there's water, // oxygen, // ozone, // the things that might tell us that // it could harbor life // .
I think // this is the coolest possible science // . That's why I got into doing this, // because / I think // that will change the world // . That will change everything / when we see that // .
So / what I want to try to do is / tell a quick story about a 404 page / and a lesson // that was learned as a result of it // . But / to start it probably / helps to have an understanding of / what a 404 page actually is // .
The 404 page is that // . It's that broken experience on the Web // . It's effectively the default page // when you ask a website for something // and it can't find it // . And / it serves you the 404 page // . It's inherently a feeling of being broken // when you go through it // . And / I just want you to think a little bit about, // remember for yourself, // it's annoying / when you hit this thing // . Because / it's the feeling of a broken relationship // .
And / that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, // where does 404 come from // ? It's from a family of errors actually - // a whole set of relationship errors, // which, // when I started digging into them, // it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist / or a couples counselor // . You sort of get down there to the bottom // and things get really dicey // .
But / these things are everywhere // . They're on sites big, // they're on sites small // . This is a global experience //.
What a 404 page tells you is that // you fell through the cracks // . And / that's not a good experience / when you're used to experiences like this // . You can get on your Kinect // and you can have unicorns dancing / and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone // . A 404 page is not what  you're looking for // . You get that, // and it's like a slap in the face // . Trying to think about / how a 404 felt, // and it would be like / if you went to Starbucks // and there's the guy behind the counter // and you're over there // and there's no skim milk // . And / you say, // "Hey, // could you bring the skim milk // ?" And / they walk out from behind the counter // and they've got no pants on // . And / you're like, // "Oh, // I didn't want to see that // ." That's the 404 feeling // .
So / where this comes into play // and why this is important is / I head up a technology incubator, // and we had eight startups sitting around there // . And / those startups are focused on what they are, // not what they're not, // until one day Athletepath, // which is a website / that focuses on services for extreme athletes, / found this video //.
Renny Gleeson: // You just ... // no, // he's not okay // . They took that video // and they embedded it in their 404 page // and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place // . Because / finally there was a page / that actually felt like / what it felt like to hit a 404 // .
So / this turned into a contest // . Dailypath / that offers inspiration / put inspiration on their 404 page // . Stayhound, // which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, // commiserated with your pet // . Each one of them found this // . It turned into a 24-hour contest // . At 4:04 the next day, // we gave out $404 in cash // . And / what they learned was that // those little things, // done right, // actually matter, // and that well-designed moments can build brands // . So / you take a look out in the real world, // and the fun thing is / you can actually hack these yourself // . You can type in an URL // and put in a 404 // and these will pop // . This is one // that commiserates with you // . This is one // that blames you // . This is one // that I loved // . This is an error page, // but / what if this error page was also an opportunity // ?
So / it was a moment in time // where all of these startups had to sit / and think / and got really excited about what they could be // . Because / back to the whole relationship issue, // what they figured out through this exercise was that // a simple mistake can tell me / what you're not, // or it can remind me of / why I should love you // .
Ladies / and gentlemen, // gather around // . I would love to share with you a story // .
Once upon a time / in 19th century Germany, // there was the book // . Now / during this time, // the book was the king of storytelling // . It was venerable // . It was ubiquitous // . But it was a little bit boring // . Because / in its 400 years of existence, // storytellers never evolved the book / as a storytelling device // . But / then / one author arrived, // and he changed the game forever // .  His name was Lothar, // Lothar Meggendorfer // . Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, // and he said, // "Genug ist genug! // " He grabbed his pen, // he snatched his scissors // . This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy / and just decided to fold // . History would know / Lothar Meggendorfer as -- / who else // ? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book // .  For this delight / and for this wonder, // people rejoiced // .  They were happy // because / the story survived, // and that // the world would keep on spinning // .
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way / a story was told, // and he certainly wasn't the last // . Whether storytellers realized it / or not, // they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit / when they moved opera to vaudville, // radio news to radio theater, // film to film in motion / to film in sound, // color, // 3D, // on VHS / and on DVD // . There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis // .
And / things got a lot more fun // when the Internet came around // .  Because, // not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, // but / they could do so / using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices // . For example, // one company would tell a story of love / through its very own search engine // . One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D // . And / one man would tell the stories of his father / by using a platform called Twitter / to communicate the excrement / his father would gesticulate // .
And / after all this, // everyone paused; // they took a step back // . They realized that, // in 6,000 years of storytelling, // they've gone from depicting / hunting on cave walls / to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls // . And / this was a cause for celebration // . The art of storytelling has remained unchanged // . And / for the most part, // the stories are recycled // . But / the way / that humans tell the stories  / has always evolved with pure, / consistent novelty // .
And / they remembered a man, // one amazing German, // every time a new storytelling device popped up next // . And for that, // the audience --//  the lovely, / beautiful audience --//  would live happily ever after // . 

As a kid, // I was fascinated with all things air / and space // . I would watch Nova on PBS // . Our school would show Bill Nye / the Science Guy // . When I was in elementary school, // my next door neighbor, // he gave me a book for my birthday // . It was an astronomy book, // and I poured over that thing for hours on end, // and it was a combination of all these things // that inspired me to pursue space exploration / as my own personal dream, // and part of that dream was, // I always wanted to just fly around the solar system // and visit different planets // and visit moons // and spacecraft // .
Well, // a number of years later, // I graduated from UCLA // and I found myself at NASA, // working for the jet propulsion laboratory, // and there / our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system, // and today / I want to show you what we've done so far // .
Now, // the kicker is, // everything I'm about to do here / you can do at home, // because / we built this for the public for you guys to use //.
So / what you're looking at right now is the Earth // . You can see the United States / and California / and San Diego, // and you can use the mouse / or the keyboard to spin things around // .
Now, // this isn't new // . Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before, // but / one thing we like to say in our group is, // we do the opposite of Google Earth // . Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard // . We go from this view out to the stars // . So / the Earth is cool, // but / what we really want to show are the spacecraft, // so I'm going to bring the interface back up, // and now / you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth // . These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters // . We haven't included military satellites / and weather satellites / and communication satellites / and reconnaissance satellites // . If we did, // it would be a complete mess, // because / there's a lot of stuff out there // . And the cool thing is, // we actually created 3D models / for a number of these spacecraft, // so / if you want to visit any of these, // all you need to do is double-click on them // .
So / I'm going to find the International Space Station, // double-click, // and it will take us all the way down to the ISS // . And now / you're riding along with the ISS / where it is right now //.
And / the other cool thing is, // not only can we move the camera around, // we can also control time, // so / I can slide this jog dial here / to shuttle time forward, // and now / we can see / what a sunset on the ISS would look like, // and they get one every 90 minutes // . (Laughter)
All right, // so what about the rest of it // ? Well, // I can click on this home button over here, // and that will take us up to the inner solar system, // and now / we're looking at the rest of the solar system // . You can see, // there's Saturn, // there's Jupiter, // and while we're here, // I want to point out something // . It's actually pretty busy // .
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory / on its way to Mars, // just launched last weekend //.
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, // there // . We have Dawn orbiting Vesta, // and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto //.
And / I mention this // because / there's this strange public perception // that NASA's dead, // that the space shuttles stopped flying // and all of the sudden // there's no more spacecraft out there // .
Well, // a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration, // and we have a lot of spacecraft out there // . Granted, // we're not sending humans up at the moment, // well at least with our own launch vehicles, // but / NASA is far from dead, // and one of the reasons / why we write a program like this is // so that / people realize that // there's so many other things / that we're doing //.
Anyway, // while we're here, // again, // if you want to visit anything, // all you need to do is double-click. // So / I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, // and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, // and this is happening right now // . I'm going to double-click on Uranus, // and we can see Uranus rotating on its side / along with its moons // . You can see / how it's tilted at about 89 degrees // .
And / just being able to visit different places / and go through different times, // we have data from 1950 to 2050 // . Granted, // we don't have everything in between, // because / some of the data is hard to get // . Just being able to visit places in different times, // you can explore this for hours, // literally hours on end, // but / I want to show you one thing in particular, // so I'm going to open up the destination tab, // spacecraft outer planet missions, // Voyager 1, // and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby // . So now / we've gone back in time // . We're now riding along with Voyager 1 // . The date here is November 11, / 1980 // .
Now, / there's a funny thing going on here // . It doesn't look like anything's going on // . It looks like / I've paused the program // . It's actually running at real rate right now, // one second per second, // and in fact, // Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan / at I think / it's 38,000 miles per hour // . It only looks like nothing's moving because, // well, // Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, // and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away // . It's just the vastness of space / makes it look like nothing's happening // .
But / to make it more interesting, // I'm going to speed up time, // and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan, // which is a hazy moon of Saturn // . It actually has a very thick atmosphere // . And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, // here //.  I'm going to pull out, // and I want to show you Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn // .
There's a point to be made here //.  With a 3D visualization like this, // we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn // . There's a whole story to tell here // . And even better, // because / it's an interactive application, // you can tell the story for yourself. // If you want to pause it, // you can pause it. // If you want to keep going, // if you want to change the camera angle, // you can do that, // and because of that, // I can show you that / Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn // . It actually flies underneath Saturn // . Now, // what happens is, // as it flies underneath Saturn, // Saturn grabs it gravitationally / and flings it up / and out of the solar system, // so if I just keep letting this go, // you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that // . And, // in fact, // I'm going to go back to the solar system // . I'm going to go back to today, // now, // and I want to show you / where Voyager 1 is // . Right there, // above, // way above the solar system, // way beyond our solar system //.
And / here's the thing // . Now you know / how it got there // . Now you know why, // and to me, // that's the point of this program // . You can manipulate it yourself // . You can fly around yourself // and you can learn for yourself // .
You know, // the theme today is // "The World In Your Grasp // ."  Well, // we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp // — (Laughter) — and we hope / once it's there, // you'll be able to learn for yourself // what we've done out there, // and what we're about to do // . And my personal dream is / for kids to take this / and explore / and see the wonders out there / and be inspired, // as I was as a kid, // to pursue STEM education / and to pursue a dream in space exploration //.
