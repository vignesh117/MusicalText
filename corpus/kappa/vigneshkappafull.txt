I came here to show you the Fotokite // . It's a tethered, / flying camera // . But / before I do that, // I want to tell you a bit / about where it came from, / what motivated it // .
So / I was born in Russia, / and three years ago, / in 2011, / there were the Russian federal elections // . There were massive irregularities reported, // and people came out to protest, / which was very unlikely for Russia // . And no one really knew / how significant these protests were, // because, // for whatever reason, // the world media largely ignored it // . Now, // there was a group of photographers // who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby /  usually photographing things like the Sphinx, / the Pyramids / who happened to be right around the corner, // and they flew a camera / and they took some snapshots, / some panoramas of this demonstration // . Just completely independent entity, / completely random occurrence, / and the image, // when I saw it, // it really struck me // . Here's one of the panoramas // . So in a single image, // you can really see the scale of this event / just the number of people, // the colors, // the banners // . You just can't consider this insignificant // . All in a single image, / which was really cool to me // .
And I think, // in the future, // journalism / and many other professions, // there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there, // but / I think, // you wait a few months, // a few years, // and for many professions, // it's really going to be a requirement // .
And it make sense // . It's such a unique perspective // . Nothing really communicates this scale, // for example, // in context, // in a way that this does // . But / there are a few hurdles, // and they are quite basic / and quite fundamental // .
One is piloting // . So / for this image, // they flew a camera, // a five kilogram device with an SLR under it // . It's quite heavy, // lots of spinning, // sharp things // . It's a bit uncomfortable to fly, // probably also for the operator // . In fact, // you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, // it says, // "No questions until landing" // in Russian / and in English, // because / people are curious, // and they'll go tap you, // and then / you lose your focus / and things happen // . And these guys are great // . They're professionals; // they're really careful in what they do // . So / in the protests, // maybe you noticed, // they flew over the river / so it was quite safe // . But / this doesn't necessarily apply to all people / and all conditions, // so we really have to make piloting easier // .
The other problem is regulations, // or rather, // the lack of good regulation // . For many good reasons, // it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws / to regulate flying cameras // . So we already have cameras // . Everyone here, // I'm sure, // has a smartphone with a camera, // right // ? There are more and more of them // . You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked // . You hear about, // actually, // a drone pilot, // a hobbyist, // was attacked two weeks ago // because / he was flying near a beach // . Here's some personal input / I didn't expect // . Just yesterday, // I was attacked by a guy // who claimed that / I was filming him // . I was checking my email right here  // easy way to get input for your talk // . But I think there are better solutions // . I think we have to defuse the situation // . We have to come up with responsible solutions // that address the privacy issues / and the safety, / accountability issues // but / still give us that perspective // .
And this is one potential solution // . So this is the Fotokite // . Well, // let me see, // it's a quadrocopter, // but / what's kind of special about it is / there's a leash // . It's literally a dog leash // . It's very convenient // . And / the neat thing about it is, // to fly it, // there's no joysticks, // nothing like this // . You just turn it on // and you point in the direction / that you want to fly // . You give it a little twist // . That's kind of the way / you communicate // . And there it goes // .
So / the interaction is super simple // . It's like a personal flying pet // . It just always maintains a certain angle to you, // and if I move around with it, // it'll actually follow me naturally // . And of course, // we can build on top of this // . So / this leash has some additional electronics // . You can turn it on // . And now, // it's like telling your dog to fly lower, // if you have such a dog // . So, / I can press a button / and manipulate it rather easily // . So / I just shifted its position // .
And / it's really safe // . I don't know about you guys in the front row // (Laughter) // but / at least in principle, // you have to agree that // you feel safer // because / there is a physical connection // . Live demos are hard, // right // ? Things go wrong all the time // . But / no matter what, // this thing will actually prevent this thing / from going into you // . What's more, // it tells you immediately that // I am the one responsible for this device // . You don't have to look for someone controlling it // .
Now, // I can tell you that it's easy a lot, // but / I think a really good way to prove that is // to grab a second one / and launch it // . And / if I can do this on stage live, // then / I can show each / and every one of you in five minutes / how to operate one of these devices // .
So now / we have two eyes in the sky // . And now / the trick is getting them back // .
So / my question now to you is, // well, // it's a nice solution, // it's very accessible, // it's safe // . What would you use it for // ? What would you use such a camera for in your life // ?
So / just by a show of hands, // how many of you all have a robot at home // ? Not very many of you // . Okay // . And actually of those hands, // if you don't include Roomba // how many of you have a robot at home // ? So a couple // . That's okay // . That's the problem that // we're trying to solve at Romotive -- // that I / and the other 20 nerds at Romotive / are obsessed with solving // .
So / we really want to build a robot // that anyone can use, // whether you're eight / or 80 // . And as it turns out, // that's a really hard problem, // because you have to build a small, / portable robot // that's not only really affordable, // but / it has to be something // that people actually want to take home / and have around their kids // . This robot can't be creepy / or uncanny // . He should be friendly / and cute // .
So / meet Romo // . Romo's a robot / that uses a device you already know and love -- // your iPhone --  as his brain // . And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor, / we can create a robot / that is wi-fi enabled / and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks, / which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past // .
When Romo wakes up, // he's in creature mode // . So / he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face // . If I duck down, // he'll follow me // . He's wary, // so he'll keep his eyes on me // . If I come over here, // he'll turn to follow me // . If I come over here -- // He's smart // . And / if I get too close to him, // he gets scared just like / any other creature // . So / in a lot of ways, // Romo is like a pet // that has a mind of his own // . Thanks, // little guy // .  Bless you // .
And / if I want to explore the world -- // uh-oh, // Romo's tired -- // if I want to explore the world with Romo, // I can actually connect him from any other iOS device // . So / here's the iPad // . And Romo will actually stream video to this device // . So / I can see everything / that Romo sees, // and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world // . Now / this is a free app on the App Store, // so / if any of you guys had this app on your phones, // we could literally right now share control of the robot / and play games together // .
So / I'll show you really quickly, // Romo actually - // he's streaming video, // so you can see me / and the entire TED audience // . If I get in front of Romo here // . And / if I want to control him, // I can just drive // . So / I can drive him around, // and I can take pictures of you // . I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience // . So / I'll snap a picture // . And in the same way // that you scroll through content on an iPad, // I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device // . So / there are all of you through Romo's eyes // . And finally, // because / Romo is an extension of me, // I can express myself through his emotions // . So / I can go in // and I can say / let's make Romo excited // .
But / the most important thing about Romo is that // we wanted to create something // that was literally completely intuitive // . You do not have to teach someone / how to drive Romo // . In fact, // who would like to drive a robot // ? Okay // . Awesome // . Here you go // . Thank you, / Scott // .
And even cooler, // you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot / to control him // . So / he actually streams two-way audio / and video between any two smart devices // . So / you can log in through the browser, // and it's kind of like Skype on wheels // . So / we were talking before about telepresence, // and this is a really cool example // . You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, // for example, // who has an iPhone, // and her mom buys her a robot // . That girl can take her iPhone, // put it on the robot, // send an email to Grandma, // who lives on the other side of the country // . Grandma can log into that robot // and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter / for fifteen minutes / every single night, / when otherwise / she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once / or twice a year // .
So / those are a couple of the really cool things // that Romo can do today // . But / I just want to finish by talking about something // that we're working on in the future // . This is actually something / that one of our engineers, // Dom, // built in a weekend // . It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly // . This allows you to drag / and drop these blocks of semantic code // and create any behavior for this robot you want // . You do not have to know / how to code to create a behavior for Romo // . And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, // which is what you see Romo doing on the left // . And then / if you have something you like, // you can download it onto your robot / and execute it in real life, // run the program in real life // . And then / if you have something you're proud of, // you can share it with every other person / who owns a robot in the world // . So / all of these wi-fienabled robots actually learn from each other // .
The reason / we're so focused on building robots / that everyone can train is that // we think / the most compelling use cases in personal robotics / are personal // . They change from person to person // . So / we think that // if you're going to have a robot in your home, // that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination // .
So / I wish that // I could tell you / what the future of personal robotics looks like // . To be honest, // I have no idea // . But / what we do know is that // it isn't 10 years / or 10 billion dollars / or a large humanoid robot away // . The future of personal robotics is happening today, // and it's going to depend on small, / agile robots like / Romo / and the creativity of people / like yourselves // . So / we can't wait to get you all robots, // and we can't wait to see / what you build // .
When I was a child growing up in Maine, // one of my favorite things to do was / to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, // because / my parents told me // it would bring me luck // . But / you know, // these shells, // they're hard to find // . They're covered in sand, // they're difficult to see // . However, // over time, // I got used to looking for them // . I started seeing shapes / and patterns // that helped me to collect them // .
This grew into a passion for finding things, / a love for the past and archaeology // . And eventually, // when I started studying Egyptology, / I realized that / seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough // . Because / all of the sudden, / in Egypt, / my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine / to one eight hundred miles long, // next to the Nile // . And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities // . This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery // . For trying to map the past, / I knew that / I had to see differently // .
So / I want to show you an example of / how we see differently using the infrared // . This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called / Mendes // . And / the site visibly appears brown, // but / when we use the infrared // and we process it, // all of the sudden, // using false color, // the site appears as bright pink // . What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape / caused by the building materials / and activities of the ancient Egyptians // .
What I want to share with you today is // how we've used satellite data / to find an ancient Egyptian city, / called Itjtawy, // missing for thousands of years // . Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, // at a period of time / called the Middle Kingdom, // about four thousand years ago // . The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, // and the site is really important, // because / in the Middle Kingdom // there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, / architecture / and religion // . Egyptologists have always known // the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings / who built it, // indicated within the red circles here, / but somewhere within this massive flood plain // . This area is huge - // it's four miles by three miles in size // . The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, // and as it shifted / and changed / and moved over time to the east, / it covered over the city // .
So, / how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape // ? Finding it randomly would be the equivalent oflocating a needle in a haystack, / blindfolded, / wearing baseball mitts // .
So / what we did is // we used NASA topography data / to map out the landscape, // very subtle changes // . We started to be able to see // where the Nile used to flow // . But / you can see in more detail, // and even more interesting, // this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here // which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy // .
So / we collaborated with Egyptian scientists / to do coring work, / which you see here // . When I say coring, // it's like ice coring, / but / instead of layers of climate change, / you're looking for layers of human occupation // . And, / five meters down, / underneath a thick layer of mud, / we found a dense layer of pottery // . What this shows is that / at this possible location of Itjtawy, / five meters down, / we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, / dating to the Middle Kingdom, / dating to the exact period of time / we think Itjtawy is // . We also found work stone - // carnelian, / quartz / and agate / that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here // . These might not look like much, / but / when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry / from the Middle Kingdom, // these are the stones / that were used .
So, / we have a dense layer of occupation / dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site // . We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, / showing that / whatever was there / was a very important city // . No Itjtawy was here yet, // but / we're going to be returning to the site / in the near future / to map it out // . And even more importantly, // we have funding to train young Egyptians / in the use of satellite technology / so they can be the ones / making great discoveries as well // .
So / I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom - //  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy / four thousand years ago // . "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings // . There's nothing like it in the land // ." So / as it turns out, // TED was not founded in 1984 AD // .
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC / at a not-lost-for-long city, // found from above // . It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective // .
Cholera was reported in Haiti / for the first time / in over 50 years last October // . There was no way to predict / how far it would spread through water supplies / and how bad the situation would get // . And / not knowing / where help was needed / always ensured that // help was in short supply in the areas / that needed it most // .
We've gotten good at predicting / and preparing for storms / before they take innocent lives / and cause irreversible damage, // but / we still can't do that with water, // and here's why // . Right now, // if you want to test water in the field, // you need a trained technician, // expensive equipment like this, // and you have to wait about a day / for chemical reactions to take place / and provide results // . It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground // before they change, // too expensive to implement in all the places // that require testing // . And / it ignores the fact that, // in the meanwhile, // people still need to drink water // . Most of the information / that we collected on the cholera outbreak / didn't come from testing water; // it came from forms like this, // which documented all the people / we failed to help // .
Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines - //  a simple / and invaluable way for miners to know / whether they're safe // . I've been inspired by that simplicity / as I've been working on this problem / with some of the most hardworking / and brilliant people / I've ever known // . We think // there's a simpler solution to this problem - // one that can be used by people // who face conditions like this everyday // .
It's in its early stages, // but / this is what it looks like right now // . We call it the Water Canary // . It's a fast, / cheap device // that answers an important question: // Is this water contaminated // ? It doesn't require any special training // . And / instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // it uses light // . That means // there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, // no need to use reagents // that can run out / and no need to be an expert / to get actionable information // .
To test water, // you simply insert a sample / and, // within seconds, // it either displays a red light, // indicating contaminated water, // or a green light, // indicating the sample is safe // . This will make it possible for anyone / to collect life-saving information / and to monitor water quality conditions / as they unfold // .
We're also, // on top of that, // integrating wireless networking into an affordable device / with GPS / and GSM // . What that means is that // each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers / to be mapped in real time // . With enough users, // maps like this / will make it possible to take preventive action, // containing hazards before they turn into emergencies // that take years to recover from // . And / then, // instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people / who need it most,  // it can happen automatically // .  We've seen / how distributed networks, // big data / and information can transform society // . I think it's time for us / to apply them to water // .
Our goal over the next year is / to get Water Canary ready for the field / and to open-source the hardware // so that anyone can contribute to the development / and the evaluation, // so we can tackle this problem together // .
I collaborate with bacteria // . And / I'm about to show you / some stop-motion footage // that I made recently / where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment / over the period of an hour // .
So / what you're seeing here is / the bacteria metabolizing, // and as they do so // they create an electrical charge // . And / this attracts metals from their local environment // . And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria // .
One of the most pervasive problems in the world today / for people is // inadequate access to clean drinking water // . And / the desalination process is one / where we take out salts // . We can use it for drinking / and agriculture // . Removing the salts from water - // particularly seawater -// through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries // who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe // .
So / seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology // . We take the water from the sea // and we apply pressure // . And / this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane // . This takes energy, // producing clean water // . But / we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, / or brine // .
But / the process is very expensive // and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe // . And also, // the brine / that's produced / is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea // . And / this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area // that it's pumped back out into // .
So / I work in Singapore at the moment, // and this is a place // that's really a leading place for desalination technology // . And / Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water // . But / this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine // . And / this is where / my collaboration with bacteria comes into play // .
So / what we're doing at the moment is // we're accumulating metals like calcium, / potassium / and magnesium from out of desalination brine // . And this, // in terms of magnesium // and the amount of water / that I just mentioned, // equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore - // a place that doesn't have any natural resources // .
So / I'd like you / to image a mining industry in a way // that one hasn't existed before; // imagine a mining industry // that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; // imagine bacteria helping us do this / by accumulating / and precipitating / and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine // . And / what you can see here is / the beginning of an industry in a test tube, // a mining industry // that is in harmony with nature // .
