My name is Amit // .And 18 months ago, // I had another job at Google, // and I pitched this idea of doing something / with museums / and art to my boss // who's actually here, // and she allowed me to do it // .And it took 18 months // .A lot of fun, // negotiations / and stories, // I can tell you, // with 17 very interesting museums / from nine countries // .But / I'm going to focus on the demo // .There are a lot of stories about // why we did this // .

I think / my personal story is explained very simply / on the slide, // and it's access // .And / I grew up in India // .I had a great education // -- I'm not complaining // -- but / I didn't have access to a lot of these museums / and these artworks // .And so // when I started traveling / and going to these museums,// I started learning a lot // .And / while working at Google, // I tried to put this desire / to make it more accessible / with technology together // .So we formed a team, // a great team of people, // and we started doing this // .

I'm going to probably get into the demo / and then tell you a couple of the interesting things // we've had since launch // .So, // simple: // you come to GoogleArtProject.com // .You look around at all these museums here // .You've got the Uffizi, // you've got the MoMA, // the Hermitage, / the Rijks, / the Van Gogh // .I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, // the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York // .Two ways of going in // -- very simple // .Click and, / bang, // you're in this museum // .It doesn't matter / where you are // -- Bombay, / Mexico, // it doesn't really matter // .You move around, // you have fun // .You want to navigate around the museum // ? Open the plan up, // and, / in one click, // jump // .You're in there, // you want to go to the end of the corridor // .Keep going // .Have fun // .Explore // .

Thanks // .I haven't come to the best part // .

So now // I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, // "The Harvesters" / by Pieter Bruegel / at the Met // .I see this plus sign // .If the museum has given us the image, // you click on it // .Now / this is one of the images // .So / this is all of the meta-data information // .For those of you who are truly interested in art, // you can click this // -- but / I'm going to click this off right now // .And / this is one of these images // that we captured in / what we call gigapixel technology // .So this image, // for example, // has close to, // I think, // around 10 billion pixels // .And / I get a lot of people asking me: // "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" // So / I'm going to try / and show you / what you really get for 10 billion pixels // .You can zoom around very simply // .You see some fun stuff happening here // .I love this guy; // his expression is priceless // .

But / then you really want to go deep // .And / so I started playing around, // and I found something going on over here // .And / I was like, // "Hold on // .That sounds interesting." // Went in, // and I started noticing that // these kids were actually beating something // .I did a little research, / spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, / and actually found out that this is a game called squall, // which involves beating a goose / with a stick on Shrove Tuesday // .And apparently // it was quite popular // .I don't know // why they did it, // but / I learned something about it // .Now / just to get really deep in, // you can really get to the cracks // .Now / just to give you some perspective, // I'm going to zoom out / so you really see what you get // .Here is where we were, // and this is the painting // .

The best is yet to come // -- so in a second // .So now / let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, // again in New York // .So another one of my favorites, // "The Starry Night." // Now the example / I showed you was all about finding details // .But / what if you want to see brush strokes // ? And / what if you want to see / how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece // ? You zoom in // .You really go in // .I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts / in this painting, // and I'm really going to get to the cracks // .This is "The Starry Night," // I think, // never seen like this before // .

I'm going to show you my other favorite feature // .There's a lot of other stuff here, // but / I don't have time // .This is the real cool part // .It's called Collections // .Any one of you, // anybody //-- doesn't matter / if you're rich, // if you're poor, // if you have a fancy house // -- doesn't matter // .You can go / and create your own museum online // -- create your own collection / across all these images // .Very simply,// you go in // -- and I've created this, // called The Power of Zoom // -- you can just zoom around // .This is "The Ambassadors," // based in the National Gallery // .You can annotate the stuff, // send it to your friends / and really get a conversation going about / what you're feeling / when you go through these masterpieces // .

So I think, // in conclusion, // for me, // the main thing is that // all the amazing stuff here / does not really come from Google // .It doesn't, // in my opinion, // even come from the museums // .I probably shouldn't say that // .It really comes from these artists // .And that's been my humbling experience in this // .I mean, // I hope in this digital medium / that we do justice to their artwork / and represent it properly online // .And the biggest question / I get asked nowadays is, // "Did you do this / to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" // And the answer is no // .It's to supplement the experience // .
What do you do // when you have a headache // ? You swallow an aspirin // .But / for this pill to get to your head, // where the pain is, // it goes through your stomach, / intestines / and various other organs first // .

Swallowing pills / is the most effective / and painless way /of delivering any medication in the body // .The downside, // though, // is that // swallowing any medication leads to its dilution // .And this is a big problem, // particularly in HIV patients // .When they take their anti-HIV drugs, // these drugs are good / for lowering the virus in the blood, // and increasing the CD4 cell counts // .But / they are also notorious / for their adverse side effects, // but / mostly bad, // because // they get diluted by the time / they get to the blood, // and worse, // by the time they get to the sites / where it matters most: // within the HIV viral reservoirs // .These areas in the body // -- such as the lymph nodes, // the nervous system, // as well as the lungs // -- where the virus is sleeping, // and will not readily get delivered / in the blood of patients / that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy // .However, // upon discontinuation of therapy, // the virus can awake / and infect new cells in the blood // .

Now, // all this is a big problem in treating HIV / with the current drug treatment, // which is a life-long treatment / that must be swallowed by patients // .One day, // I sat / and thought, // "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly / within its reservoir sites, // without the risk of drug dilution?" // As a laser scientist, // the answer was just before my eyes: // Lasers, // of course // .If they can be used for dentistry, // for diabetic wound-healing / and surgery, // they can be used for anything imaginable, // including transporting drugs into cells // .

As a matter of fact, // we are currently using laser pulses / to poke / or drill extremely tiny holes, // which open / and close almost immediately / in HIV-infected cells, // in order to deliver drugs within them // ."How is that possible?" // you may ask // .Well, // we shine a very powerful // but / super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells // while these cells are immersed in liquid / containing the drug // .The laser pierces the cell, // while the cell swallows the drug / in a matter of microseconds // .Before you even know it, // the induced hole becomes immediately repaired // .

Now, // we are currently testing this technology / in test tubes / or in Petri dishes, // but / the goal is to get this technology in the human body, // apply it in the human body // ."How is that possible?" // you may ask // .Well, // the answer is: // through a three-headed device // .Using the first head, // which is our laser, // we will make an incision in the site of infection // .Using the second head, // which is a camera, // we meander to the site of infection // .Finally, // using a third head, // which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, // we deliver the drugs / directly at the site of infection, // while the laser is again used / to poke those cells open // .

Well, // this might not seem like / much right now // .But one day, // if successful, // this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body // .Yes // .A cure for HIV // .This is every HIV researcher's dream // -- in our case, // a cure lead by lasers // .
So I was trained to become a gymnast / for two years in Hunan, // China in the 1970s // .When I was in the first grade, // the government wanted to transfer me to a school / for athletes, // all expenses paid // .But / my tiger mother said, // "No // ." My parents wanted me to become an engineer / like them // .After surviving the Cultural Revolution, // they firmly believed // there's only one sure way to happiness // : a safe / and well-paid job // .It is not important // if I like the job / or not.

But / my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer // .That is me playing my imaginary piano // .An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, // so I tried everything I could / to go to opera school // .I even wrote to the school principal / and the host of a radio show // .But / no adults liked the idea // .No adults believed // I was serious // .Only my friends supported me, // but / they were kids, // just as powerless as I was // .So at age 15, // I knew I was too old to be trained // .My dream would never come true // .I was afraid that // for the rest of my life / some second-class happiness would be the best / I could hope for // .

But / that's so unfair // .So I was determined to find another calling // .Nobody around to teach me // ? Fine // .I turned to books // .

I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book / by a family of writers / and musicians.// ["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] //

I found my role model of an independent woman // when Confucian tradition requires obedience // .["Jane Eyre"] //

And I learned to be efficient from this book // .["Cheaper by the Dozen"] //

And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these // .

["Complete Works of Sanmao" // (aka Echo Chan) // ] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] //

I came to the U.S. in / 1995, // so which books did I read here first // ? Books banned in China, // of course // ."The Good Earth" / is about Chinese peasant life // .That's just not convenient for propaganda // .Got it // .The Bible is interesting, // but / strange // .That's a topic for a different day // .But / the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany // : "You shall honor your father / and mother // ." "Honor // ," I said // ."That's so different, // and better, // than obey // ." So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap / and to restart my relationship with my parents // .

Encountering a new culture / also started my habit of comparative reading // .It offers many insights // .For example, // I found this map out of place at first // because / this is what Chinese students grew up with // .It had never occurred to me, // China doesn't have to be at the center of the world // .A map actually carries somebody's view // .Comparative reading actually / is nothing new // .It's a standard practice / in the academic world // .There are even research fields // such as comparative religion / and comparative literature // .

Compare / and contrast / gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic // .So I thought, // well, // if comparative reading works for research, // why not do it in daily life too // ? So I started reading books in pairs // .So they can be about people // -- ["Benjamin Franklin" / by Walter Isaacson]// ["John Adams" / by David McCullough] // -- who are involved in the same event, // or friends with shared experiences // .["Personal History" / by Katharine Graham] // ["The Snowball:// Warren Buffett / and the Business of Life, // " by Alice Schroeder] // I also compare the same stories / in different genres // -- [Holy Bible: // King James Version] // ["Lamb" / by Chrisopher Moore] // -- or similar stories from different cultures, // as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book // .["The Power of Myth" / by Joseph Campbell] // For example, // both the Christ / and the Buddha went through three temptations // .For the Christ, // the temptations are economic, / political / and spiritual // .For the Buddha, // they are all psychological: // lust, / fear / and social duty // -- interesting // .

So if you know a foreign language, // it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages // .["The Way of Chuang Tzu" // Thomas Merton]// ["Tao: / The Watercourse Way" // Alan Watts] // Instead of lost in translation, // I found / there is much to gain // .For example, // it's through translation that // I realized / "happiness" in Chinese literally means / "fast joy." // Huh // ! "Bride" / in Chinese literally / means "new mother." //

Books have given me a magic portal / to connect with people of the past / and the present // .I know / I shall never feel lonely / or powerless again // .Having a dream shattered really / is nothing compared to / what many others have suffered // .I have come to believe that / coming true / is not the only purpose of a dream // .Its most important purpose is / to get us in touch with // where dreams come from, // where passion comes from, // where happiness comes from // .Even a shattered dream can do that for you // .

So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. So may books be always with you.
So, / if you're in the audience today, / or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time / or place, // you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem // .Whether you're an artist, / a technologist, / a lawyer / or a fan, // the handling of copyright directly impacts your life // .Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, // it's a complex web of relationships / and a critical part of our cultural landscape // .YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, // but / in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, / mashups / and more, // we need to first identify / when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site // .

Let's look at a specific video / so you can see how it works // .Two years ago, // recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever." // A fan saw it on TV, // recorded it with her camera phone, // and uploaded it to YouTube // .Because / Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, // within seconds of attempting to upload the video, // the copy was detected, // giving Sony the choice of what to do next // .

But / how do we know that / the user's video was a copy // ? Well, // it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, // along with a usage policy / that tells us what to do / when we find a match // .We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database // .This heat map is going to show you / how the brain of the system works // .Here we can see the original reference file / being compared to the user generated content // .The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match // .This means that // we can identify a match / even if the copy used is / just a portion of the original file, / plays it in slow motion / and has degraded audio / and video quality // .And we do this every time / that a video is uploaded to YouTube // .And that's over 20 hours of video every minute // .When we find a match, // we apply the policy / that the rights owner has set down // .

And the scale / and the speed of this system / is truly breathtaking.// We're not just talking about a few videos, // we're talking about over 100 years of video every day, // between new uploads / and the legacy scans // we regularly do across all of the content on the site // .When we compare those hundred years of video, // we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database // .It would be like 36,000 people / staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, // without so much as a coffee break // .

Now, // what do we do when we find a match // ? Well,// most rights owners, // instead of blocking, // will allow the copy to be published // .And then they benefit through the exposure, // advertising / and linked sales // .Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever" // ? Well, // it had its day in the sun / and then it dropped off the charts, // and that looked like the end of the story, // but / sometime last year, // a young couple got married // .This is their wedding video // .You may have seen it // .

What's amazing about this is, // if the processional of the wedding / was this much fun, // can you imagine / how much fun the reception must have been // ? I mean, // who are these people // ? I totally want to go to that wedding // .

So / their little wedding video went on / to get over 40 million views // .And instead of Sony blocking, // they allowed the upload to occur // .And they put advertising against it / and linked from it to iTunes // .And the song, // 18 months old, // went back to number four on the iTunes charts // .So / Sony is generating revenue from both of these // .And Jill / and Kevin, // the happy couple, // they came back from their honeymoon / and found that / their video had gone crazy viral // .And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, // and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference // .The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence // .The "JK Wedding Dance" / became so popular that / NBC parodied it on the season finale of "// The Office, // " which just goes to show, // it's truly an ecosystem of culture // .Because / it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, // but / sometimes big studios borrowing back.

By empowering choice, // we can create a culture of opportunity // .And all it took to change things around / was to allow for choice through rights identification // .So / why has no one ever solved this problem before // ? It's because / it's a big problem, // and it's complicated / and messy // .It's not uncommon for a single video / to have multiple rights owners // .There's musical labels // .There's multiple music publishers // .And each of these can vary by country // .There's lots of cases / where we have more than one work mashed together.// So/ we have to manage many claims to the same video // .

YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases // .But / the system only works through the participation of rights owners // .If you have content / that others are uploading to YouTube, // you should register in the Content ID system, // and then / you'll have the choice about / how your content is used // .And think carefully about the policies / that you attach to that content // .By simply blocking all reuse, // you'll miss out on new art forms, / new audiences, / new distribution channels / and new revenue streams // .

But / it's not just about dollars / and impressions.// Just look at all the joy / that was spread through progressive rights management / and new technology // .And I think / we can all agree that / joy is definitely an idea worth spreading // .
I was born in Taiwan // .I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, // and I like going to night markets // .I love the energy of the night markets, // the colors, // the lights, // the toys, // and all the unexpected things / I find every time / I go, // things like / watermelon with straw antennas / or puppies with mohawks // .When I was growing up, // I liked taking toys apart, // any kind of toys / I'd find around the house, // like my brother's BB gun / when he's not home // .

I also liked to make environments for people / to explore / and play // .In these early installations, // I would take plastic sheets, / plastic bags, / and things / I would find in the hardware store / or around the house // .I would take things like / highlighter pen, // mix it with water, // pump it through plastic tubing, // creating these glowing circulatory systems / for people to walk through / and enjoy // .I like these materials / because of the way they look, // the way they feel, // and they're very affordable // .

I also liked to make devices // that work with body parts // .I would take camera LED lights // and a bungee cord // and strap it on my waist // and I would videotape my belly button, // get a different perspective, // and see what it does // .

I also like to modify household appliances // .This is an automatic night light // .Some of you might have them at home // .I would cut out the light sensor, // add an extension line, // and use modeling clay, // stick it onto the television, // and then // I would videotape my eye, // and using the dark part of my eye / tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, // so / you turn on the lightbulb // .The white of the eye / and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime, // and it will shut off the light // .

I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, // so / I built this device using bicycle helmets, / some lightbulbs / and television sets // .It would be easier for other people / to wear the helmet / and record their eyes // .This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, // so / I have a diversity of eyes / to use for my other sculptures // .This sculpture has four eyes // .Each eye is controlling a different device // .This eye is turning itself around in a television // .This eye is inflating a plastic tube // .This eye is watching a video of another piece being made // .And / these two eyes are activating glowing water // .Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, / biennials, / triennial exhibitions around the world.

I love science / and biology // .In 2007, // I was doing a research fellowship at / the Smithsonian Natural History Museum / looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean // .I love these creatures // .I love the way they look, // the way they feel // .They're soft, // they're slimy, // and I was fascinated by the way / they use light in their environment, // either to attract mates, / for self-defense, / or to attract food // .This research inspired my work in many different ways, // things like movement / or different light patterns // .So / I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio / and just experimenting / and trying this out, / trying that out, // and seeing / what types of creatures / I can come up with // .I used a lot of computer cooling fans / and just kind of put them together / and see what happens // .This is an 8,000-square-foot installation / composed of many different creatures, // some hanging from the ceiling / and some resting on the floor // .From afar, // they look alien-like, // but / when you look closer, // they're all made out of black garbage bags / or Tupperware containers // .

I'd like to share with you // how ordinary things can become something magical / and wondrous // .
In 2012, // when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque / in my hometown of Gabes, // in the south of Tunisia, // I never thought that // graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.//

At the beginning, // I was just looking for a wall / in my hometown, // and it happened that // the minaret was built in '94 // .And for 18 years, // those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey // .When I met the imam for the first time, // and I told him / what I wanted to do, // he was like, // "Thank God you finally came," // and he told me that // for years // he was waiting for somebody / to do something on it // .The most amazing thing about this imam / is that // he didn't ask me anything // -- neither a sketch, // or what I was going to write.//

In every work / that I create, // I write messages / with my style of calligraffiti // -- a mix of calligraphy / and graffiti // .I use quotes / or poetry // .For the minaret, // I thought that // the most relevant message to be put on a mosque // should come from the Quran, // so I picked this verse: // "Oh humankind, // we have created you from a male / and a female, // and made you people / and tribe, // so you may know each other." // It was a universal call for peace, / tolerance, / and acceptance / coming from the side // that we don't usually portray / in a good way in the media // .

I was amazed to see // how the local community reacted to the painting, // and how it made them proud / to see the minaret getting so much attention / from international press all around the world // .For the imam, // it was not just the painting; // it was really deeper than that // .He hoped that // this minaret would become a monument for the city, // and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia // .The universality of the message, // the political context of Tunisia at this time, // and the fact that // I was writing Quran in a graffiti way / were not insignificant // .It reunited the community // .

Bringing people, // future generations, // together through Arabic calligraphy / is what I do // .Writing messages / is the essence of my artwork // .What is funny, // actually, // is that // even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot / to decipher / what I'm writing // .You don't need to know the meaning / to feel the piece // .I think that // Arabic script touches your soul / before it reaches your eyes // .There is a beauty in it // that you don't need to translate // .Arabic script speaks to anyone, // I believe; // to you, / to you, / to you, / to anybody, // and then // when you get the meaning, // you feel connected to it // .I always make sure to write messages // that are relevant to the place // where I'm painting, // but messages / that have a universal dimension, // so anybody around the world can connect to it // .

I was born / and raised in France, / in Paris, // and I started learning // how to write / and read Arabic // when I was 18 // .Today // I only write messages in Arabic // .One of the reasons / this is so important to me, / is // because of // all the reaction / that I've experienced all around the world // .

In Rio de Janeiro, // I translated this Portuguese poem / from Gabriela Torres Barbosa, // who was giving an homage to the poor people / of the favela, // and then // I painted it on the rooftop // .The local community were really intrigued by what / was doing, // but / as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, // they thanked me, // as they felt connected to the piece // .

In South Africa, // in Cape Town, // the local community of Philippi / offered me the only concrete wall of the slum // .It was a school, // and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, // saying, // "[in Arabic]," // which means, // "It seems impossible until it's done." // Then this guy came to me / and said, // "Man, // why you don't write in English?" // and I replied to him, // "I would consider your concern legit // if you asked me // why I didn't write in Zulu."//

In Paris, // once, // there was this event, // and someone gave his wall to be painted // .And / when he saw / I was painting in Arabic, // he got so mad // -- actually, // hysterical // -- and he asked for the wall to be erased // .I was mad / and disappointed // .But / a week later, // the organizer of the event asked me to come back, // and he told me that // there was a wall / right in front of this guy's house // .So, // this guy like, // was forced to see it every day // .At the beginning, // I was going to write, // "[In Arabic]," // which means, // "In your face," // but / -- (Laughter) I decided to be smarter // and I wrote, // "[In Arabic]," // which means, // "Open your heart." //

I'm really proud of my culture, // and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it / through my artwork // .And I hope that // I can break the stereotypes / we all know, // with the beauty of Arabic script // .Today, // I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall // .I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy / to be broken, // as it's art // and you can appreciate it / without knowing the meaning, // as you can enjoy any music / from other countries // .Some people see that // as a rejection / or a closed door, // but for me, // it's more an invitation // -- to my language, // to my culture, // and to my art // .
I'm really excited to share with you some findings / that really surprise me about / what makes companies succeed the most, // what factors actually matter the most for startup success // .

I believe that / the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place // .If you take a group of people / with the right equity incentives / and organize them in a startup, // you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible // .You get them to achieve unbelievable things // .

But / if the startup organization is so great, // why do so many fail // ? That's what I wanted to find out // .I wanted to find out / what actually matters most for startup success // .

And I wanted to try to be systematic about it, // avoid some of my instincts / and maybe misperceptions / I have from so many companies I've seen over the years // .

I wanted to know this because // I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old // when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school, // to high school, / when I made solar energy devices, // to college, / when I made loudspeakers // .And when I graduated from college, // I started software companies // .And 20 years ago, // I started Idealab, // and in the last 20 years, // we started more than 100 companies, / many successes, / and many big failures // .We learned a lot from those failures // .

So I tried to look across // what factors accounted the most for company success / and failure // .So I looked at these five // .First, // the idea // .I used to think that / the idea was everything // .I named my company Idealab / for how much I worship the "aha!" moment // when you first come up with the idea // .But / then over time, // I came to think that // maybe the team, / the execution, / adaptability, / that mattered even more than the idea // .

I never thought / I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,// but he once said, // "Everybody has a plan, // until they get punched in the face." // And I think / that's so true about business as well // .So much about a team's execution is / its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer // .The customer is the true reality // .And that's why / I came to think that / the team maybe was the most important thing // .

Then I started looking at the business model // .Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues // ? That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe / what mattered most for success // .

Then I looked at the funding // .Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding // .Maybe that's the most important thing // ?

And then of course, // the timing // .Is the idea way too early / and the world's not ready for it // ? Is it early, // as in, // you're in advance / and you have to educate the world // ? Is it just right // ? Or is it too late, // and there's already too many competitors // ?

So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies // .And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies, // and 100 non-Idealab companies to try / and come up with something scientific about it // .

So first, // on these Idealab companies, // the top five companies // -- Citysearch, / CarsDirect, / GoTo, / NetZero, / Tickets.com / -- those all became billion-dollar successes // .And the five companies on the bottom // -- Z.com, // Insider Pages, // MyLife, // Desktop Factory, // Peoplelink // -- we all had high hopes for, // but didn't succeed // .

So I tried to rank across all of those attributes / how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions // .And then for non-Idealab companies, // I looked at wild successes, // like Airbnb / and Instagram / and Uber / and Youtube / and LinkedIn // .

And some failures: // Webvan, // Kozmo, // Pets.com Flooz // and Friendster // .The bottom companies had intense funding, // they even had business models in some cases, // but they didn't succeed // .I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success / and failure across all of these companies, // and the results really surprised me // .

The number one thing was timing // .Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure // .Team and execution came in second, // and the idea, // the differentiability of the idea, // the uniqueness of the idea, // that actually came in third // .

Now, // this isn't absolutely definitive, // it's not to say that the idea isn't important, // but it very much surprised me that // the idea wasn't the most important thing // .Sometimes it mattered more / when it was actually timed // .

The last two, // business model / and funding, // made sense to me actually // .I think business model makes sense to be that low // because you can start out without a business model // and add one later if your customers are demanding / what you're creating // .And funding, // I think as well, // if you're underfunded at first // but / you're gaining traction, // especially in today's age, // it's very, / very easy to get intense funding // .

So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these // .So take a wild success like Airbnb // that everybody knows about // .Well, // that company was famously passed on by many smart investors // because people thought, // "No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger." // Of course, // people proved that wrong // .But one of the reasons it succeeded, // aside from a good business model, // a good idea, // great execution, // is the timing // .

That company came out right during the height of the recession // when people really needed extra money, // and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger // .

Same thing with Uber // .Uber came out, // incredible company, // incredible business model, // great execution, // too // .But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system // .Drivers were looking for extra money; // it was very, / very important // .

Some of our early successes, // Citysearch, // came out when people needed web pages // .GoTo.com, // which we announced actually at TED in 1998, // was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic // .We thought the idea was so great, // but actually, // the timing was probably maybe more important // .And then some of our failures // .We started a company called Z.com, // it was an online entertainment company // .We were so excited about it // -- we raised enough money, // we had a great business model, // we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company // .But / broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000 // .It was too hard to watch video content online, // you had to put codecs in your browser / and do all this stuff, // and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 // .

Just two years later, // when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash // and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America, // YouTube was perfectly timed // .Great idea, // but unbelievable timing // .In fact, // YouTube didn't even have a business model / when it first started // .It wasn't even certain that // that would work out // .But / that was beautifully, / beautifully timed // .

So what I would say, // in summary, // is execution definitely matters a lot // .The idea matters a lot // .But / timing might matter even more // .And the best way to really assess timing is // to really look at / whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them // .And to be really, / really honest about it, // not be in denial about any results that you see, // because / if you have something you love, // you want to push it forward, // but / you have to be very, / very honest about that factor on timing // .

As I said earlier, // I think startups can change the world / and make the world a better place // .I hope some of these insights / can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio, // and thus make something great come to the world // that wouldn't have happened otherwise // .

Thank you very much, // you've been a great audience // .
Ladies and gentlemen, // gather around // .I would love to share with you a story.//

Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, // there was the book // .Now during this time, // the book was the king of storytelling // .It was venerable // .It was ubiquitous // .But it was a little bit boring // .Because in its 400 years of existence, // storytellers never evolved the book / as a storytelling device // .But / then / one author arrived, // and he changed the game forever // .His name was Lothar, // Lothar Meggendorfer // .Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, // and he said, // "Genug ist genug!" // He grabbed his pen, // he snatched his scissors // .This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy / and just decided to fold // .History would know Lothar Meggendorfer / as // -- who else // ? -- the world's first true inventor / of the children's pop-up book // .For this delight / and for this wonder, // people rejoiced // .They were happy / because // the story survived, // and that / the world would keep on spinning // .

Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first / to evolve the way a story was told, // and he certainly wasn't the last // .Whether storytellers realized it / or not, // they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit // when they moved opera to vaudville, // radio news to radio theater, // film to film in motion / to film in sound, / color, / 3D, / on VHS / and on DVD // .There seemed to be no cure / for this Meggendorferitis // .

And things got a lot more fun / when the Internet came around // .Because, // not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, // but / they could do so / using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices // .For example, // one company would tell a story of love / through its very own search engine // .One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D // .And / one man would tell the stories of his father / by using a platform called Twitter // to communicate the excrement / his father would gesticulate // .

And / after all this, // everyone paused; // they took a step back // .They realized that, // in 6,000 years of storytelling, // they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls / to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls // .And / this was a cause for celebration // .The art of storytelling has remained unchanged // .And / for the most part, // the stories are recycled // .But / the way / that humans tell the stories / has always evolved with pure, // consistent novelty // .

And / they remembered a man, // one amazing German, // every time a new storytelling device popped up next // .And for that,// the audience // -- the lovely, // beautiful audience // -- would live happily ever after // .
My students / and I work on very tiny robots // .Now, // you can think of these as robotic versions of something / that you're all very familiar with: // an ant // .We all know that / ants / and other insects at this size scale / can do some pretty incredible things // .We've all seen a group of ants, / or some version of that, / carting off your potato chip at a picnic, / for example // .

But / what are the real challenges of engineering these ants // ? Well, // first of all, // how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale // ? Well, // first / we need to figure out how to make them move / when they're so small // .We need mechanisms like / legs / and efficient motors / in order to / support that locomotion, // and we need the sensors, / power / and control in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot // .And finally, // to make these things really functional, // we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things // .

So I'll start with mobility // .Insects move around amazingly well // .This video is from UC Berkeley // .It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain / without tipping over, / and it's able to do this // because / its legs are a combination of rigid materials, // which is what / we traditionally use to make robots, / and soft materials // .Jumping is another really interesting way to get around / when you're very small // .So these insects store energy in a spring / and release that really quickly / to get the high power they need to jump out of water, / for example // .

So one of the big contributions from my lab / has been to combine rigid / and soft materials in very, / very small mechanisms // .So this jumping mechanism / is about four millimeters on a side, / so really tiny // .The hard material here is silicon, / and the soft material is silicone rubber // .And the basic idea is that // we're going to compress this, // store energy in the springs, // and then release it to jump // .So there's no motors on board this right now, // no power // .This is actuated with a method / that we call in my lab / "graduate student with tweezers." // So what you'll see in the next video / is this guy / doing amazingly well for its jumps // .So this is Aaron, / the graduate student in question, / with the tweezers, / and what you see is / this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high // .That's almost 100 times its own length // .And it survives, // bounces on the table, // it's incredibly robust, // and of course / survives quite well /until we lose it / because it's very tiny // .

Ultimately, // though, // we want to add motors to this too, // and we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors / to eventually integrate onto small, / autonomous robots // .But / in order to look at mobility / and locomotion / at this size scale to start, // we're cheating / and using magnets // .So this shows // what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg, // and you can see the silicone rubber joints / and there's an embedded magnet / that's being moved around by an external magnetic field // .

So this leads to the robot / that I showed you earlier // .The really interesting thing / that this robot can help us figure out // is how insects move at this scale // .We have a really good model / for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves // .We all move in this kind of bouncy way / when we run // .But / when I'm really small, // the forces between my feet / and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass, // which is what causes that bouncy motion // .So this guy doesn't work quite yet, // but / we do have slightly larger versions that do run around // .So this is about a centimeter cubed, / a centimeter on a side, / so very tiny, / and we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second, / so 10 centimeters per second // .It's pretty quick for a little, / small guy, / and that's really only limited by our test setup // .But / this gives you some idea of how it works right now // .We can also make 3D-printed versions of this / that can climb over obstacles, // a lot like the cockroach / that you saw earlier // .

Ultimately / we want to add everything onboard the robot // .We want sensing, / power, / control, / actuation all together, / and not everything needs to be bio-inspired // .So / this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac // .And in this case, // instead of magnets or muscles to move this around, // we use rockets // .So / this is a micro-fabricated energetic material, / and we can create tiny pixels of this, / and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot, / and this robot, / then, / is going to jump / when it senses an increase in light // .

So / the next video is one of my favorites // .So / you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air // .It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size // .And you'll see a big flash at the beginning / when the energetic is set off, // and the robot tumbling through the air // .So / there was that big flash, // and you can see the robot jumping up through the air // .So there's no tethers on this, // no wires connecting to this // .Everything is onboard, // and it jumped in response to the student / just flicking on a desk lamp next to it.//

So / I think you can imagine all the cool things / that we could do with robots / that can run / and crawl / and jump / and roll at this size scale // .Imagine the rubble / that you get after a natural disaster / like an earthquake // .Imagine these small robots running through that rubble / to look for survivors // .Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge / in order to inspect it / and make sure it's safe / so you don't get collapses like this, // which happened outside of Minneapolis in 2007 // .Or just imagine / what you could do / if you had robots / that could swim through your blood // .Right // ? "Fantastic Voyage,"// Isaac Asimov // .Or they could operate / without having to cut you open in the first place.// Or we could radically change the way we build things // if we have our tiny robots work the same way / that termites do, // and they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds, // effectively well ventilated apartment buildings / for other termites in Africa / and Australia // .

So I think / I've given you some of the possibilities / of what we can do with these small robots // .And / we've made some advances so far, // but / there's still a long way to go, // and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination // .
