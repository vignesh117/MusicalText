There is // always some input to the functions //. OK// so there’s some input flowing into the function // and whatever comes into the function // the function does something to it, // changes it / and give you some different possibly thing - // the output and // just to review some of the key terms // the input comes / from a bin right // some places called the domain // whatever the legal input is of your function // whatever you can put into the machine without breaking it // those things make up the domain // and // whatever might come out of the function right // whatever output might come out // the set of all possible outputs is / the range of the function // . so these are the key things // we’re talking about in this section // . Does anyone have any questions right now about this stuff // ?
